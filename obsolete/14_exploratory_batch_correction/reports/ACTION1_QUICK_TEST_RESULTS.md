# Action 1 Quick Test Results: Log2 Standardization

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Test:** Does log2 scale standardization improve driver recovery?
**Result:** ❌ **NO IMPROVEMENT** - Driver recovery remains 20% (1/5)

---

## Executive Summary

**Hypothesis:** Mixed linear/log2 scales cause poor driver recovery (20%)
**Test:** Standardize all abundances to log2 scale, re-run percentile normalization
**Outcome:** **FAILED** - Driver recovery unchanged at 20%

**Interpretation:** Scale inconsistency is NOT the primary cause of poor cross-study comparability. The root issue is likely:
1. **Insufficient statistical power** (N=3-5 studies per protein)
2. **True biological heterogeneity** across tissues/species/ages
3. **Percentile ranking inherently removes magnitude information**

**Recommendation:** **FALLBACK to Option 3** (within-study analyses only) - DO NOT proceed with ComBat

## 1.0 Test Methodology

### 1.1 Data Preparation

**Step 1: Log2 Standardization**
```
Script: preprocessing/02_standardize_log2_scale.py
Method: Conditional log2 transformation
  - Linear scale (>100): log2(x + 1)
  - Ambiguous (10-100): log2(x + 1)
  - Log2 scale (≤10): preserved
Runtime: 0.3 seconds
```

**Results:**
- Original range: [0.04, 202 million] (6-7 orders of magnitude)
- Standardized range: [0.04, 27.59] (all log2 scale)
- Median: 1,306.70 → 10.35 (consistent log2)

**Step 2: Long Format Transformation**
```
Input: merged_ecm_standardized_log2.csv (9,343 rows)
Output: merged_ecm_standardized_long_format.csv (18,277 rows)
Key: Used Abundance_Old_log2 / Abundance_Young_log2 columns
```

**Step 3: Percentile Normalization**
```
Script: percentile_normalization/01_apply_percentile.py
Input: Standardized log2 abundances (range 0-27.59)
Method: Within-study percentile ranking (0-100 scale)
Runtime: 9.4 seconds
```

## 2.0 Results Comparison

### 2.1 Driver Protein Recovery

| Dataset | Scale | Driver Recovery | FDR Proteins | Status |
|---------|-------|-----------------|--------------|--------|
| **Original (mixed scale)** | Linear + Log2 | **1/5 (20%)** | 1 (FDR=0.54) | POOR |
| **Standardized (log2)** | All log2 | **1/5 (20%)** | 1 (FDR=0.55) | POOR |

**No change in driver recovery:**
- ✗ Col14a1: NOT in top 20 (both datasets)
- ✗ COL14A1: NOT in top 20 (both datasets)
- ✓ TNXB: Rank 20/20, p=0.034, FDR=0.55 (both datasets)
- ✗ LAMB1: NOT in top 20 (both datasets)
- ✗ PCOLCE: NOT in top 20 (both datasets)

### 2.2 Meta-Analysis Statistics

| Metric | Original | Standardized | Change |
|--------|----------|--------------|--------|
| **Proteins tested** | 326 | 326 | 0 |
| **Significant (p<0.05)** | 29 (8.9%) | 29 (8.9%) | 0 |
| **FDR-significant (FDR<0.05)** | 1 (0.3%) | 1 (0.3%) | 0 |
| **Runtime** | 9.3 sec | 9.4 sec | +0.1 sec |

**Identical statistical results** - no improvement from standardization.

### 2.3 Top 20 Proteins

Both datasets identified the same top 20 proteins with nearly identical p-values and effect sizes.

**Most significant (both datasets):**
1. VTN (Vitronectin): ΔPercentile=+39.9, p=0.018, FDR=0.54
2. CSRP1: ΔPercentile=-27.9, p=0.029, FDR=0.55
3. VIM (Vimentin): ΔPercentile=+25.1, p=0.030, FDR=0.55

**Interpretation:** Percentile ranking produces same results regardless of input scale, because it only preserves **rank order**, not **magnitude**.

---

## 3.0 Why Log2 Standardization Failed

### 3.1 Percentile Transformation is Scale-Invariant

**Key insight:** Percentile ranking depends ONLY on rank order within each study.

**Example:**
```
Study A (original mixed scale):
  Protein 1: 200,000 (linear) → Rank 50/100 → Percentile 50
  Protein 2: 100,000 (linear) → Rank 30/100 → Percentile 30

Study A (log2 standardized):
  Protein 1: log2(200k) = 17.6 → Rank 50/100 → Percentile 50
  Protein 2: log2(100k) = 16.6 → Rank 30/100 → Percentile 30
```

**Ranks are identical → Percentiles are identical → Meta-analysis results identical**

### 3.2 The Real Problem: Loss of Magnitude Information

**What percentile ranking does:**
- Converts abundances to ranks (1st, 2nd, 3rd, ...)
- Converts ranks to percentiles (0-100 scale)
- **Discards all magnitude information**

**Why this hurts cross-study comparisons:**
- Study A: COL14A1 declines from 30.5 → 28.2 (Δ = -2.3 log2 units, 4.9-fold change)
- Study B: COL14A1 declines from 32.0 → 31.8 (Δ = -0.2 log2 units, 1.1-fold change)

**With log2 abundances:**
- Study A contributes large effect size → high statistical weight
- Study B contributes small effect size → low statistical weight
- Meta-analysis can detect consistent direction

**With percentile ranks:**
- Study A: Decline from 60th → 40th percentile (Δ = -20)
- Study B: Decline from 58th → 55th percentile (Δ = -3)
- Variance is huge (SD = 12), p-value non-significant
- **Effect sizes incomparable across studies with different protein coverage**

---

## 4.0 Alternative Hypothesis: Statistical Power

### 4.1 Sample Size Analysis

**Current study counts per protein:**
- Mean: 4 studies per protein
- Median: 4 studies
- Range: 3-5 studies (filtered to ≥3)

**Power calculation for one-sample t-test:**
```
Effect size: Cohen's d = 0.5 (medium effect)
Alpha: 0.05 (two-tailed)
Required N studies: ~17 for 80% power

Observed N: 4 studies
Estimated power: ~35%
```

**Interpretation:** Study is **severely underpowered** for cross-study meta-analysis, regardless of normalization method.

### 4.2 Evidence for Insufficient Power

**Percentile meta-analysis variance:**
- Mean SD_Delta_Percentile: 20.7
- Typical Δpercentile: -10 to +20
- Effect/SD ratio: ~1.0 (weak)

**With only N=3-5 studies:**
- SE = SD / sqrt(N) = 20.7 / sqrt(4) = 10.4
- T-statistic = Mean / SE = 15 / 10.4 = 1.44
- P-value ≈ 0.20 (non-significant)

**This explains:**
- Only 29/326 proteins nominally significant (8.9%)
- Only 1/326 FDR-significant (0.3%)
- Poor driver recovery (20% vs expected 66.7%)

## 5.0 Implications for ComBat

### 5.1 Should We Proceed with Action 2 (ComBat)?

**Arguments AGAINST:**
1. **Percentile failed despite standardization** → suggests fundamental power limitation
2. **ComBat requires moderate sample size** (N≥5 studies/batch ideal)
3. **Risk of over-correction** → may remove biological signal with low N
4. **Time investment (4 hours)** without strong evidence it will help

**Arguments FOR:**
1. ComBat preserves magnitude information (unlike percentile)
2. Empirical Bayes shrinkage may help with low N
3. ICC may improve even if driver recovery doesn't
4. Validation gates prevent publishing over-corrected results

### 5.2 Decision Recommendation

**SKIP Action 2 (ComBat) → FALLBACK to Option 3 (Within-Study Analyses)**

**Rationale:**
- Action 1 failed to show improvement (20% → 20% driver recovery)
- Root cause is likely insufficient statistical power, not correctable by batch adjustment
- Within-study findings are robust (validated independently)
- Consensus proteins (n=8, ≥2 methods) provide high-confidence subset

---

## 6.0 FALLBACK to Option 3: Within-Study Analyses Only

### 6.1 Recommended Approach

**Accept that cross-study meta-analysis is unreliable:**

1. **Report only within-study findings**
   - Q1.1.1: Col14a1 decline in Giant et al. 2017 (4/6 studies, 66.7%)
   - Q1.2: Tissue-specific aging signatures within each study
   - Q1.3: Consensus proteins (n=8, validated ≥2 independent methods)

2. **Add transparent limitations statement:**
   ```
   "Cross-study integration is limited by technical heterogeneity
   (ICC=0.29) and insufficient statistical power (N=3-5 studies per
   protein). We report within-study findings and consensus proteins
   validated by multiple independent methods."
   ```

3. **Use consensus proteins as high-confidence subset:**
   - 8 proteins validated by ≥2 methods (Spearman + Meta-Effect Size)
   - 37.5% literature validation (3/8 proteins)
   - Immune from batch effect concerns (validated independently)

### 6.2 Publication Strategy

**What to claim:**
- ✅ Col14a1 decline is consistent within Giant et al. 2017 dataset (4/6 studies)
- ✅ 8 consensus proteins show robust aging signatures
- ✅ Tissue-specific ECM remodeling patterns (within studies)

**What NOT to claim:**
- ❌ 405 universal proteins across all tissues (likely batch-driven)
- ❌ Cross-study universal aging signatures (underpowered)
- ❌ FDR-validated meta-analysis results (power=0)

**Documentation updates:**
- Update Q1.3.1 reports with Action 1 results
- Add "Within-study analyses only" disclaimer to MASTER_SYNTHESIS_REPORT.md
- Create README explaining data version choice
