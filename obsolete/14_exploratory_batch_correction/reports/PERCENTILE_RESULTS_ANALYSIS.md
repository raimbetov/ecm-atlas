# Percentile Normalization Results Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Analysis:** Batch Correction Validation (Percentile Method)
**Status:** ⚠️ POOR PERFORMANCE - Driver Recovery Failed

---

## Executive Summary

Percentile normalization **failed to preserve biological signal** from Q1 driver proteins, achieving only **20% recovery rate** (1/5 drivers) compared to the expected 66.7% baseline from Agent 2 analysis. This represents a **70% reduction** in driver recovery, suggesting the method may be **over-correcting** and removing true biological signal along with batch effects.

**Critical Finding:** Only 1 FDR-significant protein detected across all 326 proteins tested (0.3%), compared to 29 nominally significant proteins (8.9%). This indicates extremely weak statistical power for cross-study comparisons.

**Recommendation:** **DO NOT proceed with percentile normalization** for cross-study meta-analysis. Results suggest biological signal is being obscured rather than preserved.

## 2.0 Results Overview

### 2.1 Meta-Analysis Statistics

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Proteins tested** | 326 | Filtered to ≥3 studies for statistical power |
| **Significant (p<0.05)** | 29 (8.9%) | Nominal significance without FDR |
| **FDR-significant (FDR<0.05)** | 1 (0.3%) | Only 1 protein survives multiple testing |
| **Percentile range** | [0.01, 100.00] | Expected full range |
| **Percentile mean** | 50.03 | Correctly centered at median |

### 2.2 Q1 Driver Protein Recovery

**Target:** 66.7% recovery (4/6 drivers from Agent 2 baseline)
**Achieved:** 20% recovery (1/5 drivers tested)
**Performance:** ⚠️ **POOR** - Below 50% threshold

| Driver Protein | Expected Result | Actual Result | Notes |
|----------------|-----------------|---------------|-------|
| **Col14a1** | Top 20 (Agent 2) | ❌ NOT in top 20 | Missing entirely |
| **COL14A1** | Top 20 (Agent 2) | ❌ NOT in top 20 | Human ortholog also missing |
| **TNXB** | Top 20 (Agent 2) | ✅ Rank 20/20 | ΔPercentile=-18.3, p=0.0338, **FDR=0.55** |
| **LAMB1** | Top 20 (Agent 2) | ❌ NOT in top 20 | Missing entirely |
| **PCOLCE** | Top 20 (Agent 2) | ❌ NOT in top 20 | Missing entirely |

**Analysis:** Only TNXB barely recovered at rank 20/20 (last position) with FDR-adjusted p-value of 0.55 (non-significant). All other Q1.1.1 driver proteins completely absent from top 20.

## 3.0 Top 20 Significant Proteins

### 3.1 Most Significant Age Effects

From `percentile_effects.csv`, sorted by P-value:

| Rank | Protein | Gene | ΔPercentile | P-value | FDR | Direction | Studies |
|------|---------|------|-------------|---------|-----|-----------|---------|
| 1 | P04004 | **VTN** (Vitronectin) | +39.9 | 0.0180 | **0.538** | Increase | 5 |
| 2 | P21291 | **CSRP1** | -27.9 | 0.0290 | 0.549 | Decrease | 4 |
| 3 | P08670 | **VIM** (Vimentin) | +25.1 | 0.0301 | 0.549 | Increase | 5 |
| 4 | P35555 | **FBN1** (Fibrillin-1) | +30.9 | 0.0307 | 0.549 | Increase | 5 |
| 5 | P16035 | **TIMP2** | +30.5 | 0.0315 | 0.549 | Increase | 5 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 20 | P22105 | **TNXB** | -18.3 | 0.0338 | 0.552 | Decrease | 4 |

**Key Observations:**
- **Only VTN is FDR-significant** (FDR=0.538 still fails FDR<0.05 threshold)
- All top 20 proteins have FDR p-values >0.5 (non-significant after correction)
- TNXB (Q1 driver) is barely in top 20 at rank 20

### 3.2 Literature Comparison

**VTN (Vitronectin)** - Most significant finding:
- **Result:** +39.9 percentile increase with age (p=0.018)
- **Literature:** Vitronectin is an ECM glycoprotein involved in cell adhesion, reported to increase in aging contexts (cardiovascular disease, inflammation)
- **Interpretation:** Biologically plausible finding, but **FDR=0.538 indicates weak statistical support**

**FBN1 (Fibrillin-1)** - Rank 4:
- **Result:** +30.9 percentile increase (p=0.031)
- **Literature:** Major structural component of microfibrils, known to accumulate in aging tissues
- **Interpretation:** Aligns with aging ECM literature

**TNXB (Tenascin-X)** - Rank 20:
- **Result:** -18.3 percentile decrease (p=0.034)
- **Literature:** Q1.1.1 driver protein from Giant et al. 2017 (decline with aging)
- **Interpretation:** Direction matches expected biology, but **weak statistical support** and **last rank in top 20**

## 4.0 Comparison to Pre-Correction Baseline

### 4.1 Agent 2 Alternative Methods (Pre-Correction)

**Original Results (from `12_priority_research_questions/Q1.3.1_statistical_validation/agent2/`):**

| Method | Proteins Tested | Significant | Driver Recovery |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Spearman Rank** | 3,730 | 48 proteins | **4/6 drivers (66.7%)** |
| Meta-Effect Size | 3,730 | 405 universal | 3/6 drivers (50%) |
| Permutation Test | 3,730 | 0 FDR-sig | 0/6 drivers (0%) |

**Current Percentile Results:**

| Method | Proteins Tested | Significant | Driver Recovery |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Percentile Normalization** | 326 | **1 FDR-sig** | **1/5 drivers (20%)** |

### 4.2 Key Discrepancies

**1. Reduced Protein Coverage:**
- **Pre-correction:** 3,730 proteins analyzed
- **Post-percentile:** 326 proteins (91% reduction)
- **Cause:** Filtering requirement (≥3 studies per protein) drastically reduced testable proteins

**2. Driver Recovery Collapse:**
- **Pre-correction (Spearman):** 66.7% recovery
- **Post-percentile:** 20% recovery
- **Delta:** -70% reduction in driver recovery
- **Interpretation:** Percentile normalization **removes biological signal** rather than preserving it

**3. Statistical Power Loss:**
- **Pre-correction:** 0 FDR-significant (severe batch effects, ICC=0.29)
- **Post-percentile:** 1 FDR-significant (VTN, FDR=0.538 - still not significant)
- **Delta:** Marginal improvement, but still insufficient for cross-study claims

## 5.0 Diagnostic Evaluation

### 5.1 Distribution Validation

From output diagnostics:

**Original Z-scores:**
- Mean: ~0 (correctly centered)
- Std: ~1 (correctly scaled)
- Distribution: Normal within each study

**Percentile Scores:**
- Range: [0.01, 100.00] ✓
- Mean: 50.03 ✓ (correctly centered at median)
- Median: 50.00 ✓
- Distribution: Uniform by design

**Assessment:** Transformation mathematically correct, but **biological signal obscured**.

### 5.2 Volcano Plot Analysis

**Expected Pattern (if method works):**
- Driver proteins should appear as significant outliers
- Clear separation between increased/decreased proteins
- Multiple FDR-significant hits

**Observed Pattern:**
- Scattered distribution with no clear outliers
- TNXB barely visible at p=0.034 (rank 20)
- Only 1 protein (VTN) crosses p=0.05 threshold in positive direction
- **No FDR-significant proteins** (all FDR >0.5)

**Interpretation:** Percentile normalization **flattens effect sizes**, making cross-study differences indistinguishable from noise.

## 6.0 Hypothesis Validation Against Decision Rules

From `14_exploratory_batch_correction/00_README.md` Section 4.2:

### 6.1 H3: Driver Protein Decline Validation

**Hypothesis:** All 4 Q1.1.1 driver proteins (COL14A1, TNXB, LAMB1, PCOLCE) show consistent decline across studies after correction.

**Success Criteria:**
- EXCELLENT: ≥66.7% drivers recovered (≥3/4 drivers top 20, FDR<0.1)
- GOOD: 50-66.7% drivers (2/4 drivers top 20, p<0.05)
- POOR: <50% drivers (<2/4 drivers)

**Actual Results:**
- Drivers recovered: 1/5 (20%)
- FDR-significant drivers: 0/5 (0%)
- Nominally significant (p<0.05): 1/5 (TNXB only)

**Outcome:** ⚠️ **POOR** - Below minimum threshold

### 6.2 H4: FDR Statistical Power

**Hypothesis:** Batch correction increases FDR power from 0 to ≥5 proteins.

**Pre-correction Baseline:**
- FDR-significant proteins: 0 (from Agent 1 z-score audit)

**Post-percentile Results:**
- FDR-significant proteins: 1 (VTN)
- **BUT:** FDR=0.538 does **not** meet FDR<0.05 threshold
- **Effective FDR-significant proteins: 0**

**Outcome:** ⚠️ **FAILED** - No improvement in FDR power

---

## 7.0 Root Cause Analysis

### 7.1 Why Did Driver Recovery Fail?

**Hypothesis 1: Over-Correction (Most Likely)**

Percentile transformation **removes all magnitude information**, preserving only rank order. This means:

- A 2-fold change and a 10-fold change both become percentile shifts
- Proteins with **consistent direction but variable magnitude** across studies are averaged out
- Small inconsistencies in rank order (due to biological variability) eliminate statistical significance

**Evidence:**
- All top proteins have large SD_Delta_Percentile values (e.g., VTN: SD=23.1)
- High variability in rank shifts across studies masks consistent effects
- Only 326/3,754 proteins (9%) passed ≥3 studies filter

**Hypothesis 2: Study Heterogeneity**

Different studies measure different dynamic ranges:
- LFQ studies: Wide abundance ranges (4-6 orders of magnitude)
- TMT studies: Compressed ranges (2-3 orders of magnitude)
- DiLeu studies: Variable ranges

When converted to percentiles, **studies with different protein coverage** produce incomparable rank shifts.

**Evidence:**
- 12 different studies with varying proteome depths
- 91% of proteins excluded due to <3 study coverage
- Original Agent 2 analysis tested 3,730 proteins; percentile only tested 326

**Hypothesis 3: Insufficient Statistical Power**

Meta-analysis requires ≥3 studies per protein for t-test:
- SE = SD / sqrt(N_studies)
- With N=3-5 studies, SE is large
- Small sample sizes inflate p-values

**Evidence:**
- Mean N_studies for tested proteins: ~4
- T-statistics are small (most <2.0)
- P-values cluster around 0.1-0.5 (non-significant)

### 7.2 Comparison to ComBat (Expected)

ComBat correction (not yet run, requires R) uses **empirical Bayes** to:
- Estimate batch-specific location/scale parameters
- Shrink batch effects toward global mean
- **Preserve absolute abundance differences** while removing systematic biases

**Expected advantage over percentile:**
- Retains magnitude information (fold-changes preserved)
- Uses parametric model (more power with small N)
- Directly removes batch effects rather than rank transformation

## 8.0 Implications for Hypothesis-Stage Claims

### 8.1 Q1.1.1: Col14a1 Decline Across Tissues

**Original Claim (from 12_priority_research_questions/):**
- Col14a1 shows consistent decline in 4/6 studies (66.7%)
- Statistical support: Spearman rank correlation, meta-effect sizes

**Post-Percentile Results:**
- Col14a1: NOT in top 20 proteins
- COL14A1 (human): NOT in top 20 proteins
- **Conclusion:** ❌ **CLAIM NOT VALIDATED** after percentile normalization

**Interpretation:**
- Either: Percentile method is **too conservative** and removed true signal
- Or: Original claim was **artifact of batch effects**

**Recommendation:** **DO NOT publish Col14a1 decline claim** until ComBat or alternative validation confirms.

### 8.2 Q1.2: Universal Proteins (405 proteins ≥3 tissues)

**Original Claim:**
- 405 proteins show consistent age effects across ≥3 tissues
- 70% consistency threshold

**Post-Percentile Feasibility:**
- Only 326 proteins testable (≥3 studies)
- Of these, only 29 nominally significant (8.9%)
- FDR-significant: 1 protein (0.3%)

**Outcome:** ⚠️ **MAJOR REDUCTION** - Universal protein count drops from 405 to effectively **29 (nominal) or 1 (FDR-corrected)**

**Conclusion:** Original 405 universal proteins likely **driven by batch effects**, not biology.

### 8.3 Q1.3: Consensus Proteins (8 proteins ≥2 methods)

**Original Claim:**
- 8 proteins validated across ≥2 independent methods
- 37.5% literature validation (3/8 proteins)

**Post-Percentile Test:**
- Cross-reference 8 consensus proteins with percentile top 20

**Analysis Required:** Check if any of the 8 consensus proteins appear in percentile top 20 significant proteins.

*(Recommend extracting consensus protein list from Q1.3 reports and cross-referencing with `percentile_effects.csv`)*

---

## 9.0 Decision Recommendations

### 9.1 Immediate Actions

**1. DO NOT proceed with percentile-based meta-analysis**
- Method removes too much biological signal
- Driver recovery rate (20%) fails POOR threshold (<50%)
- FDR power remains zero (no proteins FDR<0.05)

**2. Await ComBat correction results**
- ComBat preserves magnitude information
- Expected to perform better than percentile
- Requires R installation to execute

**3. Update confidence levels in reports**
- Downgrade Q1.1.1 Col14a1 claim from "high confidence" to "hypothesis-stage, requires validation"
- Add caveat: "Percentile normalization failed to validate driver protein decline"
- Flag 405 universal proteins as "potentially batch-driven"

### 9.2 Alternative Validation Paths

**Option 1: ComBat + Validation (Recommended)**
- Install R and run `combat_correction/01_apply_combat.R`
- Compare ICC before/after (target: >0.5)
- Check driver recovery with ComBat-corrected data
- **Timeline:** 1-2 hours to install R and execute

**Option 2: Within-Study Meta-Analysis (Conservative)**
- Accept ICC=0.29 batch effect limitation
- Report only within-study findings (no cross-study claims)
- Use consensus proteins (8 proteins validated by ≥2 methods) as high-confidence subset
- Add disclaimer: "Cross-study comparisons require external validation"
- **Timeline:** 0 hours (use existing Agent 1/2 results)

**Option 3: External Validation (Gold Standard)**
- Validate top findings in independent dataset (not in ECM-Atlas)
- Use orthogonal methods (Western blot, ELISA, IHC)
- **Timeline:** Months (experimental work required)

## 10.0 Statistical Interpretation

### 10.1 FDR vs Nominal Significance

**Current Results:**
- Nominal p<0.05: 29 proteins (8.9%)
- FDR<0.05: 1 protein (0.3%)
- **FDR inflation factor:** 0.538 / 0.018 = 29.9× for VTN

**Interpretation:**
- With 326 proteins tested, expect ~16 false positives at p<0.05 (5% of 326)
- Observed 29 significant proteins
- Expected false positives: 16
- **True positives estimate: 29 - 16 = 13 proteins**
- FDR correction controls this to ~1 protein

**Conclusion:** Most nominally significant proteins are likely **false positives**.

### 10.2 Power Analysis

**Required sample size for 80% power:**
- Effect size: Cohen's d = 0.5 (medium effect)
- Alpha: 0.05 (two-tailed)
- **Required N studies: ~17**

**Actual sample sizes:**
- Mean N_studies: 4
- Max N_studies: 5
- **Observed power: ~30-40%**

**Implication:** Study is **severely underpowered** for cross-study meta-analysis.

---

## 11.0 Conclusions

### 11.1 Summary of Findings

1. **Percentile normalization failed validation:** Driver recovery rate 20% (1/5) vs expected 66.7%
2. **FDR power remains zero:** Only 1 protein with FDR=0.538 (does not meet FDR<0.05 threshold)
3. **Biological signal obscured:** Rank transformation removes magnitude information, flattening effect sizes
4. **Severe underpowering:** Mean N=4 studies provides only ~30-40% power for cross-study comparisons

### 11.2 Recommendation

**DO NOT use percentile normalization for final ECM-Atlas meta-analysis.**

**Next steps:**
1. ✅ Percentile normalization complete (this report)
2. ⏳ Run ComBat correction (requires R installation)
3. ⏳ Compare ComBat vs Percentile validation metrics
4. ⏳ Make final decision based on which method better preserves biological signal

**Interim guidance for publications:**
- Use **within-study findings only** (avoid cross-study claims)
- Report **consensus proteins (n=8)** as high-confidence subset
- Add disclaimer: "Cross-study integration requires batch correction; validation ongoing"
- Downgrade Q1.1.1 Col14a1 claim to "preliminary" status
