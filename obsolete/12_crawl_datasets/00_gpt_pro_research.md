Longitudinal ECM Proteomics Datasets in Aging Mammalian Tissues
Skeletal Muscle ECM Aging Datasets
	•	Deep proteome of aging skeletal muscles (PRIDE PXD015728) – Mouse, skeletal muscle. This dataset compared the proteomes of young vs. old mouse muscles with a focus on ECM changes[1]. It identified 183 extracellular matrix proteins that shift in abundance with age, many of which are produced by fibro‐adipogenic progenitors (FAPs)[1]. Notably, the study highlighted SMOC2 as an ECM protein that accumulates in aged muscle and impairs muscle stem cell (MuSC) regenerative capacity via constant integrin/MAPK signaling[2]. Data (including annotated protein tables) are available via PRIDE (PXD015728)[3] for download.
	•	Matrisome changes in aged gastrocnemius muscle (PRIDE PXD027895) – Mouse, skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius). This study examined age-related alterations in the matrisome (ECM protein ensemble) of mouse muscle using LC–MS/MS[4]. It found significant remodeling of the ECM in old muscles, including changes in collagens and other matrix components that likely contribute to sarcopenia and reduced muscle function[4]. The PRIDE dataset PXD027895 contains the raw and processed proteomics files[5], enabling detailed analysis of these age-associated ECM protein modifications.
Cardiac (Heart) ECM Aging Datasets
	•	Cardiac ECM aging signatures via hybrid scaffolds (PRIDE PXD060864) – Mouse, heart (myocardial ECM). This dataset probed ECM remodeling in young vs. old mouse hearts using decellularized native-ECM/polymer hybrid scaffolds[6]. By presenting either young or aged cardiac ECM to cultured cardiac fibroblasts (while independently tuning substrate stiffness), the study uncovered distinct age-dependent fibroblast responses[7]. Importantly, ligand cues from young cardiac ECM could outweigh the pro-fibrotic stiffness of aged matrix, keeping fibroblasts quiescent despite an “old” mechanical environment[7]. This suggests specific ECM components in young hearts that counteract fibrosis in aging. The full proteomic data (quantitative ECM protein profiles) are accessible via PRIDE (PXD060864)[8].
	•	Extracellular matrix remodeling in aging heart (PRIDE PXD040234) – Mouse & human, heart (left ventricle). A cross-species proteomic analysis quantified ~300 ECM proteins in left ventricles of young vs. old mice, as well as a progeria (HGPS) model[9]. It identified a set of 13 matrisome proteins consistently elevated with age – including lactadherin (MFGE8), collagen VIα6, vitronectin, and others – while an elastic fiber protein (fibulin-5) was decreased[10]. Notably, lactadherin was shown to accumulate in aged cardiac ECM and, when immobilized, to trigger pro-aging signals in endothelial cells (activation of GSK3β, MAPKs, mTOR and upregulation of inflammatory markers)[11]. These results link age-related ECM changes to vascular inflammation and endothelial cell aging[12]. The dataset (PRIDE PXD040234) includes the annotated protein abundance tables[13] for further exploration of cardiac ECM aging signatures.
Skin ECM Aging Dataset
	•	ECM alterations in intrinsic vs. extrinsic skin aging (PRIDE PXD015982) – Human, skin (dermis). This proteomics dataset contrasts the dermal extracellular matrix of young skin with that of intrinsically aged (older) skin, as well as photoaged skin (sun-exposed) vs. sun-protected areas[14]. Both chronological aging and photoaging were found to erode structural ECM integrity: core structural proteins (collagens, proteoglycans) decline with age, accompanied by increased collagen fibril fragmentation[14]. Intrinsically aged skin showed additional losses in elastic-fiber components and crosslinking enzymes, whereas photoaged skin was characterized by increases in elastic fiber–associated proteins and proteases that degrade the matrix[15]. Notably, proteomic signs of photoaging appear even in young adult skin exposed to UV (decades before visible damage), and both aging types share a chronic pro-inflammatory ECM signature[16]. The complete dataset (with quantitative ECM protein profiles) is deposited in PRIDE (PXD015982)[17] for public access.
Intervertebral Disc ECM Aging Datasets
	•	Proteomic atlas of young vs. old human intervertebral discs (PRIDE PXD017740) – Human, lumbar intervertebral disc (nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus). The DIPPER study generated a spatial proteomic atlas of disc ECM, comparing three discs from a young donor (16 y) to three discs from an older donor (59 y)[18][19]. In the young discs, region-specific ECM profiles were evident – e.g. the nucleus pulposus (NP) and inner annulus had high levels of proteoglycans and unique collagens, distinct from the outer annulus fibrosus[20]. Aged discs, by contrast, showed blunted regional differences and far fewer differentially expressed proteins, along with an overall enrichment of inflammation- and degradation-associated ECM proteins in both inner and outer regions[21]. Remarkably, the aged disc core contained an abundance of blood-derived proteins, suggesting that age-related degeneration allows serum components to infiltrate the normally avascular NP region[22]. All raw and processed data (matrisome protein lists, quantification matrices, etc.) are available via PRIDE (PXD017740)[23], facilitating in-depth analysis of disc ECM aging.
	•	Proteomic analysis of young vs. old nucleus pulposus (iProX PXD065307) – Human, intervertebral disc nucleus pulposus. This Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) proteomics dataset (Zhou et al., 2025) profiles nucleus pulposus tissue from young adults versus elderly individuals to uncover molecular drivers of disc aging[24]. Among the age-associated changes, the chemokine CXCL14 was identified as a key upregulated factor in old degenerative discs – it was the only molecule significantly elevated with age at both the mRNA and protein level (~3.8-fold increase in aged disc proteome)[25]. CXCL14 was shown to interact with inflammatory mediators (IL-1β, TNF-α) and activate NF-κB signaling, a pathway that drives ECM degradation and inflammation in disc degeneration[25]. The dataset (accessible through iProX, ProteomeXchange PXD065307) provides the quantitative protein data supporting these findings, offering a resource to explore disc ECM aging and degenerative disease mechanisms.
Ovarian ECM Aging Dataset
	•	Age-dependent ECM remodeling in mouse ovary (MassIVE MSV000091790 / PRIDE PXD041789) – Mouse, ovary. This dataset quantified proteome changes in ovaries from young vs. reproductively aged mice, with a special focus on the ECM (“ECM-enriched” vs. whole-tissue fractions)[26]. It identified 4,721 proteins in total, with 383 proteins significantly altered in old ovaries[27]. Aged ovaries exhibited a clear fibro-inflammatory ECM signature: elevated levels of collagens and other matrisome components, along with immunoglobulins and inflammation-related proteins, and concomitant declines in proteins related to oocyte quality and mitochondrial function[27]. Pathway analysis showed age-related suppression of DNA repair and proteostasis pathways, while immune response and ECM remodeling processes were upregulated[28]. These proteomic findings indicate that the aging ovarian microenvironment becomes stiffer and more inflammatory, which likely contributes to the decline in fertility with age[29]. All data (including downloadable protein abundance tables in CSV) are publicly available via MassIVE (ID MSV000091790) and PRIDE (PXD041789)[30].
Kidney ECM Aging Dataset
	•	Matrix-enriched proteomics of aging human kidney (PRIDE PXD026002) – Human, kidney (glomerular vs. tubulointerstitial compartments). In this dataset, human kidney samples ranging from teenage to old age (15, 29, 37, 61, 67, 69 years) were biochemically fractionated to enrich for the extracellular matrix in both glomeruli and tubulo-interstitial tissue[31]. The ECM-rich fractions were then analyzed by LC–MS/MS, providing a profile of the renal “matrisome” at different ages. While specific results are pending publication, this resource enables the investigation of age-related ECM changes in kidneys – for example, shifts in basement membrane components, collagen IV networks, or matricellular proteins associated with fibrosis and sclerosis in aging. The proteomics data (raw files and identified peptides/proteins) can be obtained from PRIDE (PXD026002)[32], offering an opportunity to uncover ECM signatures of kidney aging.
