## 1.0 High-Priority Research Questions

¶1 **Ordering:** Ranked by humanitarian impact (Tier 1 > Tier 2 > Tier 3), then feasibility.

### 1.1 Tier 1: Transformative (Billion+ Lives)

**Q1.1.1 What is the root cause of the 4 driver proteins' decline (age 30-50)?**
- **Impact:** If causal mechanism identified → upstream intervention prevents cascade
- **Context:** Call2 (36:00-37:00) - Rakhan: "Clock doesn't change by itself, must have first cause"
- **Gap:** Drivers change early but downstream effects appear later—primary trigger unknown
- **Validation path:** Multi-omics (epigenetics, transcriptomics, metabolomics) correlation analysis
- **Priority justification:** Addresses root vs. symptom; prevents aging cascade vs. treating consequences

**Q1.1.2 Can ECM protein biomarkers in blood predict biological age?**
- **Impact:** Non-invasive aging assessment → precision medicine for 8 billion people
- **Context:** Call2 (15:00-16:00) - ECM fragments detectable in blood; UK Biobank has 20-30yr longitudinal proteomics
- **Gap:** Need proof ECM proteins/fragments measurable in serum correlate with tissue-level changes
- **Validation path:** Retrospective analysis of existing cohorts (UK Biobank, Framingham)
- **Priority justification:** Enables population-scale screening; ECM clock complements epigenetic/transcriptomic clocks (multimodal superior to single-mode)

**Q1.1.3 Is there a universal cross-tissue ECM aging signature or personalized trajectories?**
- **Impact:** Universal = one-size therapy; Personalized = precision diagnostics required
- **Context:** Call2 (34:54-35:37) - Rakhan skeptical: "Each person may have different dominant aging process"
- **Gap:** Binary vs. continuous universality hypothesis needs resolution
- **Validation path:** Single-cell spatial proteomics across tissues/individuals
- **Priority justification:** Defines therapy development strategy (universal vs. stratified medicine)

### 1.2 Tier 2: Disease-Specific (Millions of Lives)

**Q1.2.1 Do systemic sclerosis and eosinophilic fasciitis patients have accelerated ECM aging?**
- **Impact:** Rare disease (orphan indication) → regulatory approval pathway + validation of aging theory
- **Context:** Call1 + Call2 (41:38-43:40) - Daniel diagnosed with systemic sclerosis (later corrected to eosinophilic fasciitis); agent found protein overlap with 4 driver candidates
- **Gap:** Need case-control proteomics; mechanism linking autoimmune fibrosis to ECM driver dysregulation
- **Validation path:** Compare ECM profiles in scleroderma patients vs. age-matched controls
- **Priority justification:** Personal relevance; therapeutic need (untreatable); proves ECM theory's clinical predictive power

**Q1.2.2 Does physical inactivity → sudden exertion trigger ECM damage via driver protein depletion?**
- **Impact:** Prevention strategy for sports injuries, age-related immobility
- **Context:** Call2 (41:58-43:08) - Daniel's illness onset after 2-week inactivity + intense soccer
- **Gap:** Mechanistic link between mechanical stress + ECM driver response unknown
- **Validation path:** Animal models (immobility + acute exercise); human biopsy studies
- **Priority justification:** Modifiable risk factor; explains injury susceptibility in sedentary populations

### 1.3 Tier 3: Methodological Foundations

**Q1.3.1 Are z-score normalization + cross-study integration statistically robust?**
- **Impact:** Validates entire ECM-Atlas methodology; ensures discoveries aren't artifacts
- **Context:** Call2 (37:20-38:32) - Rakhan: "Never seen agent challenge z-score approach; need independent validator"
- **Gap:** No external statistical audit of agent-generated analysis
- **Validation path:** Independent biostatistician review; sensitivity analysis; permutation testing
- **Priority justification:** Foundation for all conclusions; prevents catastrophic error propagation

**Q1.3.2 Do agent-generated hypotheses contain systematic hallucinations?**
- **Impact:** Trustworthiness of AI-driven science
- **Context:** Call2 (32:10-32:38) - Daniel: "Feels like sci-fi; what if agent hallucinates and we follow?" → Need bias validation agent
- **Gap:** No adversarial validation of agent conclusions
- **Validation path:** Create counter-agent explicitly searching for flaws, alternative explanations
- **Priority justification:** Prevents research dead-ends; establishes AI science credibility

**Q1.3.3 What is the minimal dataset size for reliable ECM aging signatures?**
- **Impact:** Defines feasibility of future studies; cost-benefit of proteomics scale
- **Context:** Call2 (13:22-15:02) - Need more age timepoints for accurate clock; current p-values range 0.3%-10%
- **Gap:** Power analysis for aging signature detection
- **Validation path:** Subsampling + bootstrap analysis of current data
- **Priority justification:** Guides future data collection investment
