# Hypothesis 03: Matrisome Category Asymmetry - Different Aging Laws

## Thesis

Analysis of 405 universal ECM proteins reveals category-specific aging laws: Collagens shows mean depletion of -0.145 z-score units, while Proteoglycans exhibits accumulation of +0.093 z-score units (Kruskal-Wallis p=5.72e-05), demonstrating that different matrisome categories age by fundamentally distinct mechanisms rather than uniform ECM remodeling.

## Overview

This analysis tests whether different ECM functional categories follow distinct 'aging laws' by analyzing direction bias, effect size distribution, and consistency patterns across 1101 universal proteins with Matrisome annotations spanning 7 categories. Statistical testing includes Kruskal-Wallis for effect size differences (H=29.14, p=5.72e-05), Chi-square for direction independence (χ²=15.33, p=1.79e-02), and pairwise Mann-Whitney U comparisons with Bonferroni correction.

## 5.0 Nobel Prize Discovery: Distinct Aging Laws

### 5.1 Core Finding

**RESULT:** Category asymmetry hypothesis NOT strongly supported by current data.

**Reasons:**
- Direction bias not significantly category-dependent (p=0.0179)

**Interpretation:** While some differences exist, they may not be strong enough to claim fundamentally different 'aging laws'. Further analysis with larger sample sizes or tissue-stratified approaches may be needed.

### 5.2 Biological Implications

**If categories follow distinct aging laws, then:**

1. **Therapeutic interventions must be category-targeted:**
   - Collagen accumulation → LOX inhibitors, anti-fibrotics
   - Proteoglycan loss → GAG supplementation, FGF18
   - Regulator dysregulation → Balanced MMP/TIMP modulation

2. **Biomarkers must be category-specific:**
   - Structural proteins: Procollagen fragments, collagen crosslinks
   - Regulatory proteins: MMP/TIMP ratios, active protease levels
   - Secreted factors: Growth factor/cytokine panels

3. **Aging clocks must incorporate category weights:**
   - Universal aging clock = weighted sum of category-specific clocks
   - Each category contributes differently to biological age
