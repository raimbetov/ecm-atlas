CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS:
The decline of COL14A1, PCOLCE, and related ECM driver proteins between ages 30-50
is driven by a MULTI-HIT EPIGENETIC CASCADE:

HIT 1: DNA METHYLATION (Age 30-40)
- Progressive CpG island methylation at COL14A1/PCOLCE promoters
- TET enzyme activity declines → accumulation of 5-methylcytosine
- Result: 20-30% reduction in basal transcription

HIT 2: HISTONE MODIFICATIONS (Age 35-45)
- Loss of H3K27ac at distal enhancers (active enhancer mark)
- Gain of H3K27me3 at promoters (Polycomb repression)
- H3K4me3 decline at transcription start sites
- Result: Chromatin compaction, reduced TF access

HIT 3: TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR AVAILABILITY (Age 35-50)
- SP1 protein levels decline 40-60% in fibroblasts
- AP-1 complex shifts to repressive composition
- CEBPB upregulation suppresses ECM synthesis
- Result: Even accessible chromatin has reduced TF binding

HIT 4: microRNA UPREGULATION (Age 30-50)
- miR-29 family increases → targets COL14A1 3'UTR
- miR-34a increases → promotes senescence, reduces ECM
- lncRNA H19 declines → liberates miR-29 activity
- Result: Post-transcriptional mRNA degradation

HIT 5: METABOLIC COFACTOR DEPLETION (Age 30-50)
- NAD+ decline → SIRT1/6 dysfunction → histone hyperacetylation
- α-ketoglutarate depletion → TET/KDM inactivity
- SAM/SAH ratio decline → global hypomethylation
- Result: Loss of epigenetic enzyme activity

HIT 6: INFLAMMAGING FEEDBACK (Age 40-50)
- Chronic NF-κB activation → HDAC recruitment to ECM genes
- IL-6/STAT3 → DNMT upregulation → further methylation
- Result: Inflammatory lock-in of repressed state

TIMELINE MODEL:
Age 30-35: Initial methylation changes (HIT 1)
Age 35-40: Histone modifications accumulate (HIT 2)
Age 40-45: TF decline + miRNA increase (HITs 3-4)
Age 45-50: Metabolic collapse + inflammation (HITs 5-6)
Age 50+: Full repression, downstream cascade effects observed

PREDICTION:
Interventions targeting EARLY hits (30-40) should prevent decline.
Interventions at LATE stage (50+) require multi-target approach.

TESTABLE PREDICTIONS:
1. COL14A1/PCOLCE promoter methylation increases linearly from age 30-50
2. H3K27ac at ECM enhancers peaks at age 25-30, declines 50% by age 50
3. Fibroblasts from age 40 individuals show 30% lower SP1 protein
4. miR-29 levels correlate negatively with COL14A1/PCOLCE protein (r < -0.6)
5. NAD+ boosters restore driver protein expression in aged cells
6. Combination of DNMT inhibitor + HDAC inhibitor + miR-29 antagomir
   restores driver proteins to youthful levels
