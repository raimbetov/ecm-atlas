# Provisional Patent Filing Strategy: COL14A1/PCOLCE Gene Therapy

**Thesis:** File two provisional patents within 60 days ($25-40K total) claiming AAV-PCOLCE composition and cosmetic use, convert to PCT within 12 months ($50-80K), then pursue US/EU national phase filings ($100-200K over 30 months) to secure global IP protection for $175-320K total investment.

**Overview:** This filing strategy document provides execution-ready guidance for securing patent protection on COL14A1/PCOLCE gene therapy inventions identified in PATENT_LANDSCAPE_ANALYSIS.md. Section 1.0 prioritizes patent applications by commercial value and defensive need. Section 2.0 details provisional patent preparation requirements and timelines. Section 3.0 outlines the PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty) international filing pathway. Section 4.0 specifies national phase filings in key jurisdictions. Section 5.0 provides comprehensive cost breakdown with attorney fee estimates. Section 6.0 presents decision gates and go/no-go criteria at each stage.

## 5.0 Comprehensive 5-Year Budget

### 5.1 Year-by-Year Costs

| Year | Phase | Cost (2 apps) | Cumulative |
|------|-------|---------------|------------|
| **Year 1** | Provisional + PCT | $65-110K | $65-110K |
| **Year 2** | ISR + NHP studies | $0 patent | $65-110K |
| **Year 3** | National phase + prosecution | $80-180K | $145-290K |
| **Year 4** | Prosecution | $40-80K | $185-370K |
| **Year 5** | Grant + validation | $40-90K | $225-460K |

### 5.2 Cost Optimization Strategies

**Reduce costs 20-30%:**
1. File US-only (skip PCT): Saves $40-70K but loses international rights
2. Flat fee attorney agreements: Cap costs vs. hourly billing
3. Self-draft technical examples: Reduce attorney time 20%
4. Defer Japan/China: Focus on US + 5 EU countries only
5. Use boutique biotech firms: $400-600/hr vs. $700-1,000/hr for Big Law

**Estimated savings:** $45-140K over 5 years
