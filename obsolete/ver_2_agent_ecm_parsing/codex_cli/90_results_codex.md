# Results – Codex Agent (Analysis Phase)

## Completed Deliverables
- `knowledge_base/00_dataset_inventory.md` – catalogued all Excel/TSV/HTML assets with row/column counts and study notes.
- `knowledge_base/01_paper_analysis/` – 11 study-specific analyses capturing metadata, column mappings, abundance logic, and ambiguities.
- `knowledge_base/02_column_mapping_strategy.md` – cross-study schema mapping blueprint.
- `knowledge_base/03_normalization_strategy.md` – plan for handling heterogeneous abundance units.
- `knowledge_base/04_implementation_plan.md` – parsing architecture and milestones.
- `ver_2_agent_ecm_parsing/codex_cli/progress_log_codex.md` – audit trail of study analyses.

## Key Findings & Decisions
- Confirmed age definitions for every cohort (e.g., Angelidis 3 vs 24 months, Ouni mean ages 7/26/59 years, Tam cadaver discs 16 vs 59 years).
- Identified measurement units per dataset (LFQ, iBAQ, iTRAQ, TMTpro, directDIA, log2-normalized) and documented unit-specific handling.
- Established mapping rules for challenging formats (Dipali Spectronaut exports, Chmelova transposed matrix, Tam directional profile names).
- Flagged follow-up actions: secure UniProt mapping table for gene-only resources (Chmelova), validate DiLeu log base (Li pancreas), ignore `.1` detection flags (Randles).

## Outstanding Items
- Build configuration files and parsing code per implementation plan (Tier 1+).
- Generate validation report (Tier 4) after code completion.

## Evidence Snapshot
- Analysis sources: `pdf/*.pdf`, `data_raw/*` referenced within each study analysis.
- Timestamps logged in `progress_log_codex.md`.
