Mechanism,Pathway,Primary_Target,Evidence_Strength,Age_Window,Intervention,Predicted_Effect,Rationale
NAD+ Depletion,NAD+ → SIRT1 → Autophagy → Protein Quality Control,SERPINH1 (HSP47),HIGH,30-45,"NAD+ precursors (NMN, NR)",Restore protein folding capacity,HSP47 requires functional autophagy for turnover; NAD+ decline → SIRT1 inhibition → autophagy dysfunction → HSP47 accumulation of damaged proteins
Mitochondrial ATP Depletion,Mitochondria → ATP → Protein Synthesis → Collagen Production,Col14a1 (Collagen XIV),HIGH,35-50,"Mitochondrial enhancers (CoQ10, PQQ)",Increase collagen synthesis capacity,Collagen synthesis requires massive ATP (>6000 ATP/molecule with PTMs); 15% ATP decline by age 50 creates synthesis bottleneck
Glycine Deficit,Glycine Availability → Collagen Assembly → ECM Structure,"Col14a1, LAMB1",MEDIUM-HIGH,30-60,Glycine supplementation (10-15g/day),Restore collagen synthesis substrate,Collagen is 33% glycine; 10-12g/day glycine deficit; endogenous synthesis cannot meet demand for multiple large ECM proteins
mTOR Downregulation,Energy Stress → AMPK ↑ → mTOR ↓ → Protein Translation ↓,All 4 drivers (general translation),MEDIUM,40-60,Targeted mTOR modulation (pulsed activation),Restore anabolic capacity,"Chronic energy stress activates AMPK, suppressing mTOR; reduces global protein synthesis including ECM proteins"
Proline Hydroxylation Failure,α-Ketoglutarate → Prolyl Hydroxylase → Hydroxyproline → Collagen Stability,"Col14a1, TNXB",MEDIUM,35-55,α-Ketoglutarate supplementation + Vitamin C,Improve collagen post-translational processing,Prolyl hydroxylation requires α-KG (TCA cycle intermediate); mitochondrial dysfunction → TCA cycle impairment → inadequate α-KG → incomplete hydroxylation → protein misfolding
