TESTABLE HYPOTHESES FROM SENESCENCE ANALYSIS:

H1: TEMPORAL HYPOTHESIS
   Senescent fibroblast burden increases linearly from age 30-50 and correlates
   inversely with PCOLCE, COL14A1, and COL15A1 protein abundance.

   Test: Longitudinal biopsy study measuring p16+ cells and driver proteins

H2: TISSUE SUSCEPTIBILITY HYPOTHESIS
   Tissues with highest metabolic demand and mechanical stress (skin, IVD, cartilage)
   accumulate senescent cells earliest and show strongest driver protein decline.

   Test: Multi-tissue senescence burden quantification in age-matched cohorts

H3: SASP CAUSALITY HYPOTHESIS
   SASP-secreted MMPs directly degrade driver proteins while SASP cytokines
   (IL-6, IL-8) suppress fibroblast collagen synthesis genes.

   Test: In vitro conditioned media from senescent → young fibroblasts;
         measure driver protein expression and MMP activity

H4: SENOLYTIC REVERSAL HYPOTHESIS
   Dasatinib + Quercetin treatment in age 40-60 cohort will:
   • Reduce senescent cell burden (↓p16, ↓SA-β-Gal)
   • Restore collagen synthesis (↑COL1A1, ↑PCOLCE)
   • Improve tissue ECM organization

   Test: Phase 2 clinical trial with tissue biopsies pre/post treatment

H5: p21-SMAD3-ECM PATHWAY HYPOTHESIS
   p21 activation → Rb hypophosphorylation → Rb-SMAD3 interaction →
   aberrant ECM gene expression (paradoxical fibrosis with poor quality)

   Test: ChIP-seq for Rb-SMAD3 binding at COL14A1, PCOLCE promoters in
         senescent vs. proliferative fibroblasts

H6: BIPHASIC ECM REMODELING HYPOTHESIS
   Early senescence (age 30-40): Synthesis decline dominates
   Late senescence (age 50+): Degradation increase dominates
   Both phases mediated by increasing senescent cell burden

   Test: Age-stratified analysis of synthesis/degradation enzyme ratios
