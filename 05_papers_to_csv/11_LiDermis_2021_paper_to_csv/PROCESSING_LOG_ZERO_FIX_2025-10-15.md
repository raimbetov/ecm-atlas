# LiDermis_2021 Zero-to-NaN Conversion Fix - Processing Log

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Task:** Fix zero-to-NaN conversion in LiDermis_2021 dataset
**Issue:** 785 zeros (30% of raw data) incorrectly treated as real abundance values instead of missing data (not detected)

---

## Problem Statement

In proteomics, zero values indicate "not detected" (missing data), not true zero abundance. The original processing script did not convert zeros to NaN, resulting in:

- **Raw data:** 785 zeros in 2,620 abundance measurements (30.0%)
- **LEGACY format (before fix):**
  - Abundance_Young: 22 proteins with zero (8.4%)
  - Abundance_Old: 82 proteins with zero (31.3%)
  - 8 proteins with both Young=0 AND Old=0

This caused incorrect averaging when aggregating replicate samples, as zeros were included in mean calculations instead of being treated as missing values.

---

## Solution Implemented

### Code Changes

**Modified file:** `parse_lidermis.py`

**1. Added zero-to-NaN conversion function (lines 50-66):**

```python
def convert_zeros_to_nan(df, abundance_columns):
    """
    Convert zero values to NaN in abundance columns.
    Zero in proteomics = not detected (missing), not true zero abundance.

    Args:
        df: DataFrame with abundance data
        abundance_columns: List of column names containing abundance values

    Returns:
        DataFrame with zeros converted to NaN
    """
    df_copy = df.copy()
    for col in abundance_columns:
        if col in df_copy.columns:
            df_copy[col] = df_copy[col].replace(0, np.nan)
    return df_copy
```

**2. Applied conversion immediately after loading Excel data (lines 143-166):**

```python
log("\n### Step 1.1b: Convert zeros to NaN (proteomics not-detected convention)")

# Identify abundance columns (Sample columns, not Ave_ averages)
abundance_cols = [col for col in df.columns
                 if any(x in str(col) for x in ['Toddler-Sample', 'Teenager-Sample',
                                                 'Adult-Sample', 'Elderly-Sample'])]

# Count zeros before conversion
zeros_before = sum((df[col] == 0).sum() for col in abundance_cols)
total_values = sum(df[col].notna().sum() for col in abundance_cols)

log(f"Abundance columns identified: {len(abundance_cols)}")
log(f"Zeros before conversion: {zeros_before}/{total_values} ({zeros_before/total_values*100:.1f}%)")

# Convert zeros to NaN
df = convert_zeros_to_nan(df, abundance_cols)

# Count zeros after conversion
zeros_after = sum((df[col] == 0).sum() for col in abundance_cols)
nans_total = sum(df[col].isna().sum() for col in abundance_cols)

log(f"Zeros after conversion: {zeros_after}/{total_values} ({zeros_after/total_values*100:.1f}%)")
log(f"NaN values now: {nans_total}/{total_values} ({nans_total/total_values*100:.1f}%)")
log(f"✅ Converted {zeros_before - zeros_after} zeros to NaN")
```

**3. Verified existing aggregation code:**

The `convert_to_legacy_format.py` script already had proper `skipna=True` handling in lines 48 and 67, ensuring NaN values are correctly excluded when averaging replicates.

## Validation Results

### Before Fix (from backup data):
```
Long format:   694 zeros / 2096 rows (33.1%)
LEGACY format:
  - Abundance_Young zeros: 22/262 (8.4%)
  - Abundance_Old zeros:   82/262 (31.3%)
  - Total zeros:           104
  - Proteins with both=0:  8
```

### After Fix:
```
Long format:   0 zeros / 2096 rows (0.0%)
               694 NaN values (33.1%)
LEGACY format:
  - Abundance_Young zeros: 0/262 (0.0%)
  - Abundance_Old zeros:   0/262 (0.0%)
  - Total zeros:           0
  - Proteins with both=NaN: 8
```

### Processing Statistics:
- **Zeros converted:** 785 → 0 (100% success)
- **New NaN count:** 785 (30.0% of raw measurements)
- **Affected proteins in Young group:** 22 → 0 zeros
- **Affected proteins in Old group:** 82 → 0 zeros
- **Proteins removed (both=NaN):** 8 (will be filtered in downstream analysis)

## Example: Protein A4D0S4 (LAMB4)

### Before Fix:
- Abundance_Young: 4.65 (incorrectly included zeros in averaging)
- Abundance_Old: 0.00 (false zero)
- N_Profiles: 5/3

### After Fix:
- Abundance_Young: 7.76 (correct average, excluding NaN values)
- Abundance_Old: NaN (correctly marked as not detected)
- N_Profiles: 3/0 (shows only 3 valid Young measurements)

**Impact:** The average Young abundance increased from 4.65 to 7.76 because zeros were excluded from the mean calculation, revealing the true signal from detected proteins.

## Files Regenerated

All output files were regenerated with the corrected zero-to-NaN conversion:

1. **LiDermis_2021_long_format.csv** (980 KB)
   - 2,096 rows × 13 columns
   - 0 zeros, 694 NaN values (33.1%)

2. **LiDermis_2021_long_annotated.csv** (1.1 MB)
   - Same data with ECM annotation columns added

3. **LiDermis_2021_LEGACY_format.csv** (74 KB)
   - 262 proteins × 25 columns
   - 0 zeros in Abundance columns
   - 22 NaN in Young, 82 NaN in Old (31.3% combined)

4. **agent_log.md** (full processing log with zero conversion step)

5. **agent_log_backup_2025-10-15.md** (backup of original log)

## Impact on Downstream Analysis

### Positive Changes:
- **Accurate abundance values:** Averages now reflect only detected proteins
- **Correct missing data handling:** NaN values properly propagate through analysis
- **Improved protein rankings:** Proteins with partial detection now show correct fold-changes
- **Statistical integrity:** Z-score calculations will exclude missing values appropriately

### Proteins Affected:
- **22 proteins** in Young group: Previously had zero, now NaN (not detected)
- **82 proteins** in Old group: Previously had zero, now NaN (not detected)
- **8 proteins** with both groups NaN: Will be filtered in cross-study comparisons (insufficient data)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Zero-to-NaN conversion implemented
2. ✅ Datasets regenerated with correct handling
3. ✅ Validation confirmed (0 zeros remaining)
4. [ ] Re-merge into `merged_ecm_aging_zscore.csv` (if needed)
5. [ ] Recalculate z-scores using `universal_zscore_function.py`
6. [ ] Update dashboard to reflect corrected data

## Proteomics Data Handling Standards

**Key Principle:** In label-free quantitative proteomics (LFQ), zero values mean "protein not detected in this sample," NOT "protein has zero abundance."

**Correct Handling:**
- Convert all zeros to NaN immediately after loading raw data
- Use `skipna=True` when aggregating replicates (mean, median, etc.)
- Report N_Profiles (count of non-NaN values) to show data completeness
- Filter proteins with insufficient detection across groups

**Incorrect Handling:**
- ❌ Treating zeros as real abundance values
- ❌ Including zeros in mean calculations
- ❌ Imputing zeros with arbitrary values (except specific imputation methods)
