# Zero Value Audit Report: Randles_2021 Dataset

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Dataset:** Randles_2021 (Kidney aging proteomics)
**Task:** Assess impact of converting zero values to NaN for data quality improvement

---

## Executive Summary

**Finding:** 483 zero values (1.54% of all measurements) detected across 12 samples in source data. After averaging technical replicates, 25 zero values (0.48%) remain in processed wide-format dataset.

**Recommendation:** PROCEED with 0→NaN conversion. This is a data quality improvement that aligns with proteomics standards and better represents technical reality of LC-MS detection.

**Impact:** Low-to-moderate. Proteins with mixed zero/non-zero replicates will show ~50% increase in average abundance when zeros are excluded. Total affected measurements: <2% of dataset.

## 2. Processed Data Analysis

### Wide-Format Dataset
- **File:** `Randles_2021_wide_format.csv`
- **Protein-compartment pairs:** 5,220 (2,610 proteins × 2 compartments)
- **Abundance columns:** `Abundance_Young`, `Abundance_Old` (averaged across 3 replicates each)

### Zero Value Statistics in Processed Data

| Column | Zeros | % of 5,220 pairs | NaN | Non-zero |
|--------|-------|------------------|-----|----------|
| Abundance_Young | 18 | 0.3% | 0 | 5,202 |
| Abundance_Old   | 7  | 0.1% | 0 | 5,213 |
| **TOTAL**       | **25** | **0.24%** | **0** | **10,415** |

### Example Proteins with Zero Abundances

**Abundance_Young = 0:**
- `A0A087WYX9` (COL5A2) in Kidney_Glomerular
- `D6RGZ6` (VCAN) in Kidney_Tubulointerstitial
- `F8WDW3` (ARPC4) in Kidney_Tubulointerstitial

**Abundance_Old = 0:**
- `A0A0G2JNQ3` (HNRNPCL2) in Kidney_Tubulointerstitial

## 3. Technical Replicate Pattern Analysis

### Replicate Groups
Dataset has technical replicates (3 donors per age group per compartment):
- Young_Glomerular: G15, G29, G37
- Young_Tubulointerstitial: T15, T29, T37
- Old_Glomerular: G61, G67, G69
- Old_Tubulointerstitial: T61, T67, T69

### Example Cases: Mixed Zero/Non-Zero Replicates

**Case 1: Q9H553 (ALG2) - Young Glomerular**
```
Current values: G15=105.9, G29=0.0, G37=33.0
Current average (0 included): 46.30
After 0→NaN conversion: 69.44
Impact: +50.0% increase
```

**Case 2: A0A0A0MRP6 (SMARCA1) - Young Glomerular**
```
Current values: G15=0.0, G29=61.5, G37=323.9
Current average (0 included): 128.45
After 0→NaN conversion: 192.67
Impact: +50.0% increase
```

**Pattern:** When one replicate is zero and two are non-zero, excluding the zero increases the average by 50% (reduces denominator from 3 to 2).

## 4. Impact Assessment: 0→NaN Conversion

### 4.1 Data Volume Impact
- **483** zero values (1.54% of source data) will become NaN
- **25** zero values (0.24% of processed data) will become NaN after averaging
- Current interpretation: "Protein detected with zero abundance" (biologically questionable)
- After conversion: "Protein not detected" (technically accurate)

### 4.2 Averaging Impact
**Current behavior:**
```python
# Example: [100, 0, 150]
mean([100, 0, 150]) = 83.3
```

**After 0→NaN:**
```python
# Example: [100, NaN, 150]
mean([100, 150]) = 125.0  # +50% increase
```

**Effect:** Proteins with mixed zero/non-zero replicates will show increased average abundance. This is statistically appropriate as zeros represent missing data, not true "zero abundance."

### 4.3 Biological Interpretation
**Current state:**
- Zero suggests "protein present but with zero abundance"
- Contradicts physics: molecules cannot have zero mass
- Confounds true absence with detection failure

**After fix:**
- NaN suggests "measurement missing or below detection limit"
- Aligns with LC-MS technical reality
- Separates "not detected" from "detected at low level"

### 4.4 Downstream Analysis Impact

**Z-score calculation:**
- Current: Zeros artificially deflate mean and inflate SD
- After fix: Only detected values contribute to normalization
- Result: More accurate standardization within detection range

**Statistical tests:**
- Current: Zeros treated as real measurements (incorrect)
- After fix: Sample size varies per protein (appropriate for missing data)
- Result: Tests reflect true data availability

**Visualizations (heatmaps):**
- Current: Zeros appear as low values (misleading gradient)
- After fix: NaN appears as missing/grey (honest representation)
- Result: Users see what was actually measured

### 4.5 Alignment with Field Standards
- **PRIDE database:** Recommends treating zeros as missing for LFQ data
- **ProteomeXchange:** Guidelines discourage zero imputation for absent proteins
- **MaxQuant:** Default output uses NaN for undetected proteins
- **Perseus software:** Requires NaN for proper missing value handling

## 5. Recommendation

### Decision: PROCEED with 0→NaN Conversion

**Rationale:**
1. **Low prevalence:** Only 1.54% of measurements affected
2. **Scientifically accurate:** Zeros are measurement artifacts, not biological reality
3. **Standard practice:** Aligns with proteomics community norms
4. **Improves analysis:** Prevents zero-inflation bias in statistics
5. **Preserves information:** Does not remove data, just corrects its interpretation

**Implementation:**
- Apply conversion at source data parsing step (before averaging)
- Update `pivot_to_wide_format.py` or relevant pipeline script
- Document change in dataset metadata
- Reprocess Randles_2021 dataset after fix

**Expected outcome:**
- 483 zeros → 483 NaN in long-format data
- ~25 affected proteins in wide-format (0.48% of 5,220 pairs)
- Protein averages increase by ~50% where zeros were present
- Z-scores more accurately reflect true dynamic range
