# Three-Agent Meta-Insights Validation Comparison: Fixed vs Original

**Thesis:** Fixed task instructions (claude_1_FIXED, claude_2_FIXED using explicit data source) achieved 100% PCOLCE validation agreement (all report Δz=-1.41, 7 studies) vs original confusion, but revealed new divergence in G1 universality (40.2% vs 13.45%) and G4 weak signals (394 vs 20 proteins), establishing codex as reference standard with full-schema preservation while claude agents show method-dependent metric inflation.

**Overview:** Section 1.0 compares validation outcomes across 12 insights. Section 2.0 analyzes PCOLCE success (fixed vs buggy). Section 3.0 identifies new conflicts (G1, G4). Section 4.0 shows compartment data loss. Section 5.0 provides final verdict on which agent to trust.

## 2.0 PCOLCE VALIDATION: FIXED INSTRUCTIONS SUCCESS ✅

¶1 **Ordering principle:** Buggy results → fix implementation → success metrics → interpretation.

### 2.1 Original Run (Buggy Instructions)

**Problem:** Task file didn't clarify data source vs agent identity

**Results:**
| Agent | Studies | Δz | Status | Issue |
|-------|---------|-----|--------|-------|
| Claude 1 BUGGY | 2 | -0.36 | ❌ REJECTED | Column name bug + data artifacts |
| Claude 2 BUGGY | 4 | -0.198 | ⚠️ MODIFIED | Partial filtering |
| **Codex** | **7** | **-1.41** | ✅ CONFIRMED | Correct |

**Root cause:** Claude agents loaded wrong files or applied aggressive filtering.

### 2.2 Fixed Run (Clear Instructions)

**Fix:** Explicit data source + sanity checks + visual diagrams

**Results:**
| Agent | Studies | Δz | Consistency | Status |
|-------|---------|-----|-------------|--------|
| **Claude 1 FIXED** | **7** | **-1.41** | **92%** | ✅ CONFIRMED |
| **Claude 2 FIXED** | **7** | **-1.41** | **91.7%** | ✅ CONFIRMED |
| **Codex** | **7** | **-1.41** | **92%** | ✅ CONFIRMED |

**Agreement:** 100% on PCOLCE! ✅

### 2.3 Success Metrics

**What worked in fixed instructions:**

1. ✅ **Front-loaded critical path:** V2 file path at TOP of document
2. ✅ **Separation of identity vs data source:** Visual diagram showing "YOU ARE claude_1" ≠ "YOU READ codex file"
3. ✅ **Mandatory sanity checks:** Code template with assertions (9300 rows, 28 cols, 7 PCOLCE studies)
4. ✅ **Explicit negatives:** "DO NOT use claude_1 file (has bugs)"
5. ✅ **Expected results:** Listed Δz=-1.41, 7 studies as ground truth

**Evidence of fix working:**

¶1 **Claude 1 plan (line 17):** "⚠️ Critical: Using Codex V2 file (NOT claude_1 file which has duplicate z-scores)"

¶2 **Claude 2 plan (line 17):** "Critical note: Using CODEX file (NOT claude_2 file)"

¶3 **Both agents expected values:** Claude 1 "Expected: Δz ≈ -1.41", Claude 2 "Δz=-0.82 → expected V2 ~-1.4"

**Interpretation:** Fixed instructions eliminated PCOLCE confusion completely. All 3 agents now agree.

## 3.0 NEW CONFLICTS: G1 UNIVERSALITY & G4 WEAK SIGNALS

¶1 **Ordering principle:** Conflict description → data comparison → root cause → resolution.

### 3.1 CONFLICT: G1 Universal Markers

**Agent claims:**
| Agent | Universal % | N Proteins | Change |
|-------|-------------|------------|--------|
| Claude 1 FIXED | 40.2% | 469/1,166 | +229% |
| Claude 2 FIXED | 40.2% | 469/1,167 | +229% |
| **Codex** | **13.45%** | **454/3,375** | **+10%** |

**Divergence:** 3x difference (40% vs 13%)!

**Root cause analysis:**

¶1 **Different denominators:**
- Claude agents: 1,166-1,167 total proteins
- Codex: 3,375 total proteins

¶2 **Hypothesis:** Claude agents filtered dataset before calculating universality
```python
# Likely what Claude agents did:
df_filtered = df[df.groupby('Gene').filter(lambda x: len(x) >= some_threshold)]
# This removes rare proteins → smaller denominator → higher %
```

¶3 **Codex approach:** Used full dataset (3,375 proteins) without pre-filtering

**Which is correct?**

¶1 **Codex is reference standard:**
- Full schema (28 columns vs 7)
- Larger denominator (3,375 proteins = complete dataset)
- Method documented: "universality matrix for G1 using tissue coverage"

¶2 **Claude agents may be methodologically valid but different:**
- If they filtered to "proteins with ≥N measurements" first
- Then calculated % universal among filtered set
- This is a valid but DIFFERENT metric

**Verdict:** **Accept Codex** (13.45%) as ground truth for "% of ALL proteins that are universal". Claude agents (40.2%) represent "% of WELL-MEASURED proteins that are universal" - different question.

---

### 3.2 CONFLICT: G4 Weak Signals

**Agent claims:**
| Agent | Weak Signal Proteins | Change |
|-------|---------------------|--------|
| Claude 1 FIXED | 394 | +2714% |
| Claude 2 FIXED | 246 | +1657% |
| **Codex** | **20** | **-13%** |

**Divergence:** 12-20x difference!

**Root cause analysis:**

¶1 **Different V1 baselines:**
- Claude agents: V1 = 14 proteins
- Codex: V1 = 23 proteins

¶2 **Different thresholds or filters:**
- Definition: 0.3 < |Δz| < 0.8, consistency ≥65%
- Claude agents: Applied to filtered datasets (see G1) → found hundreds
- Codex: Applied to full dataset with stricter criteria → found 20

¶3 **Biological plausibility:**
- Claude agents: +2700% expansion seems too dramatic
- Codex: -13% stability more conservative
- Expected: Batch correction SHOULD reveal more weak signals (not reduce them)

**Which is correct?**

¶1 **Codex baseline questionable:** -13% reduction contradicts batch correction benefit

¶2 **Claude agents plausible BUT:** 2700% seems extreme, suggests:
- Different filtering created artificially small V1 baseline
- Or more lenient consistency calculation

¶3 **Middle ground estimate:** True value likely 50-100 weak signal proteins (not 20, not 394)

**Verdict:** **Further investigation needed** - all 3 agents have issues:
- Codex: -13% contradicts expected batch correction benefit
- Claude 1: +2714% seems inflated
- Claude 2: +1657% more reasonable but still high

---

### 3.3 CONFLICT: G6 Compartment Antagonism

**Agent claims:**
| Agent | Antagonistic Events | Change |
|-------|-------------------|--------|
| Claude 1 FIXED | 6 | -45.5% |
| Claude 2 FIXED | N/A (deferred) | - |
| **Codex** | **264** | **+450%** |

**Root cause:**

¶1 **Data availability:** Codex file has 28 columns including `Tissue_Compartment` with granularity (Soleus, TA, NP, IAF, OAF)

¶2 **Claude agents:** Unclear if compartment data preserved after their processing
- Claude 1: Found only 6 events (vs Codex 264) → likely lost compartment granularity
- Claude 2: Deferred validation → explicit acknowledgment of missing data

**Verdict:** **Accept Codex** (264 events, +450%) - only agent with full compartment preservation

---

## 4.0 DATA SCHEMA PRESERVATION

¶1 **Ordering principle:** Schema comparison → data loss analysis → impact on metrics.

### 4.1 Schema Comparison

| Feature | Claude 1 FIXED | Claude 2 FIXED | Codex ORIGINAL |
|---------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Rows** | 9,290 | ??? | 9,300 |
| **Columns** | 7 (simplified) | 7 (simplified) | 28 (full) |
| **Canonical_Gene_Symbol** | ❌ Missing | ❌ Missing | ✅ Present |
| **Compartment details** | ⚠️ Collapsed | ⚠️ Collapsed | ✅ Preserved |
| **Matrisome metadata** | ❌ Missing | ❌ Missing | ✅ Present |
| **Quality flags** | ❌ Missing | ❌ Missing | ✅ Present |

**Key differences:**

¶1 **Codex preserves full V1 schema:**
- 28 columns including metadata (Matrisome_Category, Data_Quality, Match_Confidence)
- Compartment granularity (NP, IAF, OAF for discs; Soleus, TA for muscle)
- Both transformed and original abundances

¶2 **Claude agents use simplified schema:**
- 7 columns only (Gene_Symbol, Study_ID, Tissue_Compartment, Abundance_Young, Abundance_Old, Zscore_Delta)
- Lost metadata makes some validations impossible (pathway analysis, quality filtering)
- Compartment data may be collapsed

### 4.2 Impact on Validation

**Metrics affected by schema differences:**

| Metric | Requires | Claude Agents | Codex |
|--------|----------|---------------|-------|
| Universal markers | Tissue count | ✅ Possible | ✅ Full |
| PCOLCE Δz | Gene symbol, z-score | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| Weak signals | Z-score, consistency | ✅ Works | ✅ Full |
| Compartment antagonism | Tissue_Compartment detail | ❌ Collapsed | ✅ Full |
| Pathway aggregation | Matrisome_Category | ❌ Missing | ✅ Full |
| Quality filtering | Data_Quality | ❌ Missing | ✅ Full |

**Conclusion:** Codex has validation advantage due to full schema preservation.
