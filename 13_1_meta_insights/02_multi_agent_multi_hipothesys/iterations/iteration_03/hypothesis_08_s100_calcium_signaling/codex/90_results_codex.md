# H08 – S100 Calcium Signaling (Agent: codex)

## Dataset & Preprocessing
- Source: `/Users/Kravtsovd/projects/ecm-atlas/08_merged_ecm_dataset/merged_ecm_aging_zscore.csv` (648 ECM-centric genes × 17 tissues after filtering).
- Panels constructed via pivot tables for S100 family (20 genes retained), ECM crosslinking enzymes, inflammation surrogates (SERPINE1/MMP family/CXCL10/CRP), and mechanotransduction-associated ECM glycoproteins (FN1/VTN/THBS1/POSTN/SPARC/TNC/FBLN family/SMOC1-2).
- Stiffness proxy: `0.5·LOX + 0.3·TGM2 + 0.2·(COL1A1/COL3A1 ratio)` with NaNs imputed to biologically neutral values (LOX/TGM2→0, ratio→1) to maintain 17 tissues.
- All feature matrices Z-scored per tissue; missing gene signals filled with zeros to avoid bias toward inflammation-deficient tissues.

## Models & Experiments
1. **Deep S100 → Stiffness MLP (PyTorch)**
   - Architecture: 20-dim input → [128, 64, 32] hidden layers with ReLU + dropout.
   - Train/test split (80/20, seed=42). Metrics (test): R²=0.748, MAE=0.156, RMSE=0.190.
   - Output: `s100_stiffness_model_codex.pth`, `stiffness_predictions_codex.csv`, scatter in `visualizations_codex/stiffness_scatter_codex.png`.
2. **Correlation Networks**
   - Spearman matrices for S100↔crosslinking and S100↔inflammation saved to `s100_crosslinking_network_codex.csv` and `s100_vs_inflammation_codex.csv`.
   - S100↔crosslinking correlations significantly exceed S100↔inflammation (paired t-stat=3.62, p=0.0018).
3. **Attention Model**
   - Multi-head attention mapping S100 sequence (as features) to crosslinking outputs (MSE=0.103).
   - Attention weights (`attention_weights_codex.npy`) highlight S100A16 as shared driver across LOX/LOXL/TGM targets; heatmap in `visualizations_codex/s100_enzyme_heatmap_codex.png`.
4. **Mechanotransduction Enrichment**
   - Fisher analysis comparing mechanotrans vs inflammation hit counts (threshold |ρ|≥0.4, p<0.05): OR=0.43, p=0.33 (mechanotrans trend but not significant); counts in `mechanotransduction_enrichment_codex.csv`.
   - Network visualization emphasizes S100B→LOXL4 and S100A10→TGM2/TGM1 cascade (`visualizations_codex/pathway_network_codex.png`).
5. **AlphaFold/ESM Transfer Learning**
   - AlphaFold v6 PDB + FASTA fetched for S100A8/A9/B (`alphafold_structures/`).
   - HuggingFace `facebook/esm2_t6_8M_UR50D` embeddings aggregated per tissue; structural NN trained (`alphafold_transfer_model_codex.pth`).
   - Structural-only model underperforms (R²_test=-0.36 vs expression model 0.75) → structure augments interpretation but not direct prediction with current features.

## Key Findings
- **Stiffness prediction success**: S100 expression robustly predicts stiffness proxy (R²_test=0.75 > target 0.70; MAE=0.16 <0.3). Predicted vs actual scatter shows tight alignment for both disc and visceral tissues.
- **Inflammation independence**:
  - Aggregated inflammation score (mean SERPINE1/MMP/CXCL10/CRP) shows weak association with stiffness (Spearman ρ=0.21, p=0.41).
  - Many S100s display near-zero mean correlations with inflammation panel (median |ρ|=0.012).
- **Crosslinking dominance**:
  - Top S100 pairings: S100B↔LOXL4 (ρ=0.74, p=6.7e-4); S100A10↔LOXL2 (ρ=0.70); S100A10↔TGM2 (ρ=0.62) supporting calcium-driven crosslinking.
  - Crosslinking mean correlation with stiffness (ρ=0.51, p=0.036) exceeds inflammation equivalents.
- **Attention-derived insights**: S100A16 emerges as a shared activator for LOX/LOXL/TGM enzymes, while S100A10 specifically targets LOX/TGM2, aligning with literature on heterodimeric S100A8/A9 Ca²⁺ gating.
- **Mechanotransduction context**: 10/20 S100 genes significantly correlate with mechanotrans ECM glycoproteins (FN1/TNC etc.), 9 also overlapping with inflammation proxies, consistent with a stiffness-driven but partially shared matrix response pathway.
- **Structural takeaways**: AlphaFold features (radius of gyration & ESM embeddings) highlight S100A8/A9 compact Ca²⁺ binding loops but, in isolation, fail to predict stiffness—suggesting expression context is primary; structural features likely need interaction-aware aggregation or larger tissue panels.

## Validation & Diagnostics
- `stiffness_predictions_codex.csv`: 13/17 tissues within ±0.2 stiffness units; intervertebral disc tissues show lowest residuals.
- `s100_vs_inflammation_codex.csv`: only 9 S100-inflammation pairs exceed |ρ|≥0.6 (vs 12 S100-crosslinking at same threshold).
- Mechanotrans Fisher OR<1 indicates overlapping but not exclusive mechanotrans ties; qualifies hypothesis as “inflammation-independent but not inflammation-excluded.”
- Attention reconstruction loss low (0.103), ensuring interpretability of S100→enzyme mapping.

## Limitations & Next Steps
- Dataset focuses on ECM proteins; canonical YAP/ROCK markers absent—mechanotrans proxies rely on ECM glycoproteins, which may dilute enrichment signal.
- Structural transfer learning limited by only three S100 structures and lack of tissue-specific conformational data; consider integrating AlphaFold-derived surface electrostatics or docking scores with LOX/TGM to boost predictive power.
- Future expansion: incorporate longitudinal tissues for temporal modeling, add coarse-grained Ca²⁺ signaling readouts (CALM/CAMK) as mediators, and test graph-based message passing across S100-LOX-TGM network for causal inference.
