HYPOTHESIS 08: S100 CALCIUM SIGNALING RESOLUTION
Agent: claude_code

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Stiffness Prediction (Criterion 1: 40 pts)
   - R² = 0.8064 ✓ PASS
   - MAE = 0.0986 ✓ PASS

2. Correlation Networks (Criterion 2: 30 pts)
   - S100-Crosslinking: Mean |ρ| = 0.377
   - S100-Inflammation: Mean |ρ| = 0.000
   - Difference: ✗ NOT SIGNIFICANT

3. Top S100-Enzyme Pairs:
   - S100A8 → LOX: ρ=-0.800, p=0.2000
   - S100B → LOXL3: ρ=0.800, p=0.2000
   - S100A1 → LOX: ρ=-0.800, p=0.2000
   - S100A4 → LOXL3: ρ=0.800, p=0.2000
   - S100A16 → TGM1: ρ=0.800, p=0.2000

4. Mechanotransduction Enrichment: ✗ INSUFFICIENT DATA

5. Inflammation Independence: ? NEEDS MORE DATA
