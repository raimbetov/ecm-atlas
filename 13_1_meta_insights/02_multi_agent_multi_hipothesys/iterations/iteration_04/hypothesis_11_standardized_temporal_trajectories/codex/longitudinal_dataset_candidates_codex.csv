PXD056694,PRIDE,Calorie Restriction Modulates Four Hallmarks of Aging in Prediabetic Adults,Plasma DIA proteomics + exosomal proteins,Baseline + 8-week follow-up (40-50% calorie restriction),44 adults (â‰¥12% weight loss achieved),True longitudinal human plasma proteomics; ideal for validating pseudo-time vs. chronological intervention window.
PRJNA1185831,ENA/dbGaP,Longitudinal Multi-omic Immune Resource Reveals Dynamic Responses in Healthy Human Aging,PBMC scRNA-seq + serum proteomics (annual vaccination follow-up),96 adults sampled annually over 2 years + >300 cross-sectional,"Young (20-35y) and older (65-80y) adults, healthy",Large-scale longitudinal immune proteomics; controlled access but provides ground-truth time axis for pseudo-time benchmarking.
PXD009160,PRIDE,BXD Mouse Aging Liver Proteomics,SWATH-MS liver proteome (330 cohorts),6-24 month age range (cross-sectional cohorts),BXD mouse panel (not repeated measures),Age-graded but cross-sectional; useful as additional pseudo-time stress test yet lacks within-subject longitudinal data.
