- **Journal:** American journal of physiology. Lung cellular and molecular physiology
- **PMID:** [32964723](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32964723/)

**Abstract:** S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9) is elevated in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and aging enhances S100A9 expression in several tissues. Currently, the direct impact of S100A9-mediated signaling on lung function and within the aging lung is unknown. Here, we observed that elevated S100A9 levels in human BALF correlated with age. Elevated lung levels of S100A9 were higher in older mice compared with in young ani...

- **Authors:** Young BD, Cook ME, Costabile BK et al.
- **Year:** 2022
- **Journal:** Journal of molecular biology
- **PMID:** [36354074](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36354074/)

**Abstract:** EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins (CBPs), such as S100 proteins (S100s) and calmodulin (CaM), are signaling proteins that undergo conformational changes upon increasing intracellular Ca2+. Upon binding Ca2+, S100 proteins and CaM interact with protein targets and induce important biological responses. The Ca2+-binding affinity of CaM and most S100s in the absence of target is weak (CaKD > 1 μM). However, upon effector protein binding, the Ca2+ affinity of these proteins increases via heterotropic al...

- **Authors:** Zouharova M, Herman P, Hofbauerová K et al.
- **Year:** 2019
- **Journal:** International journal of molecular sciences
- **PMID:** [31505788](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31505788/)

**Abstract:** Transient receptor potential (TRPs) channels are crucial downstream targets of calcium signalling cascades. They can be modulated either by calcium itself and/or by calcium-binding proteins (CBPs). Intracellular messengers usually interact with binding domains present at the most variable TRP regions-N- and C-cytoplasmic termini. Calmodulin (CaM) is a calcium-dependent cytosolic protein serving as a modulator of most transmembrane receptors. Although CaM-binding domains are widespread within int...

- **Year:** 2020
- **Journal:** International journal of biological macromolecules
- **PMID:** [31821828](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31821828/)

**Abstract:** S100 proteins are EF-hand calcium-binding proteins of vertebrates exerting numerous intra- and extracellular actions and involved into multiple diseases. Some of S100 proteins serve as extracellular damage signals via interaction with receptors. Although several S100 proteins directly bind specific cytokines, this phenomenon remains underexplored. Using chemical crosslinking, intrinsic fluorescence and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopies, we show that S100P protein interacts with interferon...

### Commentary on "Novel Interaction of the Dopamine D2 Receptor and the Ca2+ Binding Protein S100B: Role in D2 Receptor Function".

- **Authors:** Lee HJ, Rodriguez-Contreras D, Neve KA
- **Year:** 2021
- **Journal:** Molecular pharmacology
- **PMID:** [34045267](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34045267/)

**Abstract:** We previously proposed that the dopamine D2 receptor-interacting protein S100B binds to a putative S100B-binding motif at residues R233-L240 toward the N terminus of the third intracellular loop. We used in vitro pull-down assays with FLAG-tagged fragments of the rat dopamine D2 receptor third intracellular loop (D2-IC3) and in vitro-synthesized S100B to evaluate this hypothesis. Our results indicate that the putative S100B-binding motif is neither necessary nor sufficient for strong binding of ...

### S100A1 Protein Does Not Compete with Calmodulin for Ryanodine Receptor Binding but Structurally Alters the Ryanodine Receptor·Calmodulin Complex.

- **Authors:** Rebbeck RT, Nitu FR, Rohde D et al.
- **Year:** 2016
- **Journal:** The Journal of biological chemistry
- **PMID:** [27226555](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27226555/)

**Abstract:** S100A1 has been suggested as a therapeutic agent to enhance myocyte Ca(2+) cycling in heart failure, but its molecular mode of action is poorly understood. Using FRET, we tested the hypothesis that S100A1 directly competes with calmodulin (CaM) for binding to intact, functional ryanodine receptors type I (RyR1) and II (RyR2) from skeletal and cardiac muscle, respectively. Our FRET readout provides an index of acceptor-labeled CaM binding near donor-labeled FKBP (FK506-binding protein 12.6) on th...

- **Authors:** Hu W, Bhattacharya S, Hong T et al.
- **Year:** 2021
- **Journal:** Biochimica et biophysica acta. Biomembranes
- **PMID:** [32835655](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32835655/)

**Abstract:** AIIt, a heterotetramer of S100A10 (P11) and Annexin A2, plays a key role in calcium dependent, membrane associations with a variety of proteins. We previously showed that AIIt interacts with the short cytoplasmic domain (12 amino acids) of CEACAM1 (CEACAM1-SF). Since the cytoplasmic domains of CEACAM1 help regulate the formation of cis- or trans-dimers at the cell membrane, we investigated the possible role of their association with AIIt in this process. Using NMR and molecular dynamics, we show...

### RIPK3-MLKL signaling activates mitochondrial CaMKII and drives intrarenal extracellular matrix production during CKD.

- **Authors:** Srivastava A, Tomar B, Sharma P et al.
- **Year:** 2022
- **Journal:** Matrix biology : journal of the International Society for Matrix Biology
- **PMID:** [35964866](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35964866/)

**Abstract:** Intrarenal extracellular matrix production or kidney fibrosis is a prevalent feature of all forms of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) is believed to be a major driver of extracellular matrix production. Nevertheless, anti-TGFβ therapies have consistently failed to reduce extracellular matrix production in CKD patients indicating the need for novel therapeutic strategies. We have previously shown that necroinflammation contributes to acute kidney injury. He...

### CaMKII inhibition due to TRIC-B loss-of-function dysregulates SMAD signaling in osteogenesis imperfecta.

- **Authors:** Besio R, Contento BM, Garibaldi N et al.
- **Year:** 2023
- **Journal:** Matrix biology : journal of the International Society for Matrix Biology
- **PMID:** [37178987](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37178987/)

**Abstract:** Ca2+ is a second messenger that regulates a variety of cellular responses in bone, including osteoblast differentiation. Mutations in trimeric intracellular cation channel B (TRIC-B), an endoplasmic reticulum channel specific for K+, a counter ion for Ca2+flux, affect bone and cause a recessive form of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) with a still puzzling mechanism. Using a conditional Tmem38b knock out mouse, we demonstrated that lack of TRIC-B in osteoblasts strongly impairs skeleton growth and s...

- **Journal:** American journal of physiology. Lung cellular and molecular physiology
- **PMID:** [28130256](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28130256/)

**Abstract:** It is now clear that in addition to activating several complex kinase pathways (Smad, MAP kinase, PI3 kinase), TGFβ also acts by elevating cytosolic Ca2+ concentration within human pulmonary fibroblasts. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamK II) is also known to regulate gene expression in fibroblasts. In this study, we examined the interactions between calcium signaling, activation of CamK and other kinases, and extracellular matrix (ECM) gene expression. Human pulmonary fibroblasts...

- **Year:** 2023
- **Journal:** The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics
- **PMID:** [37419684](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37419684/)

**Abstract:** Renal fibrosis is characterized by the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix that destroys and replaces the functional renal parenchyma, ultimately leading to organ failure. It is a common pathway by which chronic kidney disease can develop into end-stage renal disease, which has high global morbidity and mortality, and there are currently no good therapeutic agents available. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has been indicated to be closely related to the occurrenc...

### Prostaglandin E2 inhibits profibrotic function of human pulmonary fibroblasts by disrupting Ca2+ signaling.

- **Authors:** Mukherjee S, Sheng W, Michkov A et al.
- **Year:** 2019
- **Journal:** American journal of physiology. Lung cellular and molecular physiology
- **PMID:** [30758990](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30758990/)

**Abstract:** We have shown that calcium (Ca2+) oscillations in human pulmonary fibroblasts (HPFs) contribute to profibrotic effects of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and that disruption of these oscillations blunts features of pulmonary fibrosis. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) exerts antifibrotic effects in the lung, but the mechanisms for this action are not well defined. We thus sought to explore interactions between PGE2 and the profibrotic agent TGF-β in pulmonary fibroblasts (PFs) isolated from patients ...

**Abstract:** Astrocytes are important for information processing in the brain and they achieve this by fine-tuning neuronal communication via continuous uptake and release of biochemical modulators of neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. Often overlooked are their important functions in mechanosensation. Indeed, astrocytes can detect pathophysiological changes in the mechanical properties of injured, ageing, or degenerating brain tissue. We have recently shown that astrocytes surrounding mechanically-s...

**Abstract:** How hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) maintain metabolic homeostasis to support tissue repair and regeneration throughout the lifespan is elusive. Here, we show that CD38, an NAD+-dependent metabolic enzyme, promotes HSC proliferation by inducing mitochondrial Ca2+ influx and mitochondrial metabolism in young mice. Conversely, aberrant CD38 upregulation during aging is a driver of HSC deterioration in aged mice due to dysregulated NAD+ metabolism and compromised mitochondrial stress management. Th...
