### GSE288320: TRPC1 links calcium signaling to cellular senescence in the protection against post-traumatic osteoarthritis

- **Organism:** Mus musculus
- **Date:** 2025/02/10
- **URL:** https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE288320

**Summary:** Transient receptor potential channel 1 (TRPC1) is a widely expressed mechanosensitive ion channel located within the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, crucial for refilling depleted internal calcium stores during activation of calcium-dependent signaling pathways. Here, we have demonstrated that TRPC1 activity is protective within cartilage homeostasis in the prevention of cellular senescence associated cartilage breakdown during mechanical and inflammatory challenge. We revealed that TRPC1 loss i...
