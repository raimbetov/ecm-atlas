## Objective

Analyze structural evidence for S100 protein binding to calmodulin (CALM), a critical mediator in the calcium signaling cascade.

## Binding Predictions

| S100 Protein | CALM Protein | Binding | Evidence |

## Key Findings

1. **S100A1 ↔ CALM**: Direct binding demonstrated (Bousova 2022)
2. **S100B ↔ CALM**: Competitive binding with other targets (Gógl 2016)
3. **S100A10**: Preferentially binds annexin A2, not calmodulin
4. **S100A8/A9**: Form calprotectin heterodimer; CaM binding unknown

## Structural Evidence for Pathway

The existence of S100-CALM binding interfaces supports the **S100 → CALM → CAMK → LOX/TGM** pathway hypothesis. However, CALM and CAMK proteins are **missing from the proteomic dataset**, preventing direct validation of this cascade in ECM aging.
