-  (2024). *S100b treatment overcomes RAGE signaling deficits in myoblasts on advanced glycation end-product cross-linked collagen and promotes myogenic differentiation.*. American journal of physiology. Cell physiology. DOI: 10.1152/ajpcell.00502.2023
  - Source: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38314727/
  - Key: The addition of S100b (RAGE agonist) recovered the differentiation and fusion of myoblasts, and the addition of RAGE inhibitors (FPS-ZM1 and Azeliragon) inhibited the differentiation and fusion of myoblasts.  Our results provide novel insights into the role of the AGE-RAGE axis in skeletal muscle aging, and future work is warranted on the potential application of S100b as a proregenerative factor in aged skeletal muscle.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Collagen cross-linked by advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) induced myoblast proliferation but prevented differentiation, myotube formation, and RAGE upregulation.

The SAN exhibited heterogeneous autonomic innervation, which was accompanied by a web of peripheral glial cells and a novel S100B<sup>+</sup>/GFAP<sup>-</sup> interstitial cell population, with a unique morphology and a distinct distribution pattern, creating complex interactions with other cell types in the node, particularly with HCN4-expressing cells.

  - Source: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40036145/
  - Key: Blocking Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2) selectively inhibited stiffness-induced macrophage polarization without affecting IL-4-driven pro-regenerative pathways.  In functional studies, CaMKK2 deletion prevented M2-like/pro-tumoral polarization caused by matrix stiffening, which in turn hindered tumor growth.

  - Key: Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) is expressed in the vasculature and is implicated in the control of blood vessels homeostasis.  Recently, CaMKII has attracted a special attention in view of its chronic upregulated activity in diabetic tissues, yet its role in the diabetic vasculature remains under investigation.This review highlights the physiological and pathological actions of CaMKII in the diabetic vasculature, with focus on the control of the dialogue between endothelial (EC) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC).

  - Source: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37419684/
  - Key: Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has been indicated to be closely related to the occurrence of renal fibrosis, and its specific inhibitory peptide, autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide (AIP), was shown to directly bind the active site of CaMKII.  Mechanistically, AIP could significantly inhibit the activation of CaMKII, Smad 2, Raf, and extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) in vitro and in vivo and reduce the expression of transforming growth factor-<i>β</i> (TGF-<i>β</i>) in vivo.

  - Source: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37178987/
  - Key: The reduced SMAD phosphorylation and nuclear translocation were mainly caused by alteration in Ca<sup>2+</sup> calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII)-mediated signaling and to a less extend by a lower TGF-β reservoir.  SMAD signaling, osteoblast differentiation and matrix mineralization were only partially rescued by TGF-β treatment, strengthening the impact of CaMKII-SMAD axes on osteoblast function.
