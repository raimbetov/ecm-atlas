Although underlying inflammatory atrial cardiomyopathy may contribute to the development of AF, the arrhythmogenic remodeling caused by atrial inflammation has not been elucidated in detail. Herein, we examined electrical, structural, and autonomic changes in the atria in a mouse model of autoimmune myocarditis. BALB/c mice were immunized with cardiac myosin peptide (MyHC-α<sub>614-629</sub>) conjugated with complete Freund's adjuvant on days 0 and 7. Susceptibility to AF was assessed using right-atrial burst pacing. The mice immunized with MyHC-α<sub>614-629</sub> showed an inflammatory atrial cardiomyopathy phenotype, with enlarged atria; a high degree of inflammatory cell infiltration primarily consisting of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, Ly6G<sup>low</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> macrophages, and CD11c<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells; and severe interstitial fibrosis with collagen deposition. These mice demonstrated significantly enhanced susceptibility to AF, as indicated by their increased AF induction rate and duration. In addition, the expression of potassium channels (<i>Kcnh2, Kcnd3</i>, and <i>Kcnj2</i>) and calcium handling-associated genes (<i>Cacna1c</i>, <i>Camk2</i>, <i>Ryr2</i>, and <i>Atp2a2</i>) was downregulated. Connexin 40 expression was significantly downregulated, leading to frequent lateralization to the inflamed atrium. Sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation and neurotrophin expression (nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor) were upregulated in the inflamed atria.

In the present study, a novel in vitro model was developed of this phenomenon by cross linking a 3-D collagen scaffold with AGEs and investigating how myoblasts responded to such an environment. Briefly, collagen scaffolds were incubated with d-ribose (0, 25, 40, 100, or 250 mM) for 5 days at 37°C. C2C12 immortalized mouse myoblasts were grown on the scaffolds for 6 days in growth conditions for proliferation, and 12 days for differentiation and fusion. Human primary myoblasts were also used to confirm the C2C12 data. AGEs aberrantly extended the DNA production stage of C2C12s (but not in human primary myoblasts) which is known to delay differentiation in myogenesis, and this effect was prevented by RAGE inhibition. Furthermore, the differentiation and fusion of myoblasts were disrupted by AGEs, which were associated with reductions in integrins and suppression of RAGE. The addition of S100b (RAGE agonist) recovered the differentiation and fusion of myoblasts, and the addition of RAGE inhibitors (FPS-ZM1 and Azeliragon) inhibited the differentiation and fusion of myoblasts.

The CXCL4 (chemokine [C-X-C motif] ligand 4)-induced monocyte/macrophage phenotype has been implicated in atherosclerotic plaque destabilization, a key process preceding plaque rupture. Monocyte-derived macrophages differentiated with CXCL4 exhibit a unique transcriptome characterized by upregulation of S100A8 (S100 calcium-binding protein A8/calgranulin A) and MMP7 (matrix metalloproteinase-7). However, the mechanisms involved in CXCL4-induced monocyte-mediated vascular inflammation are unknown. Single-cell RNA sequencing data were examined for CXCL4-dependent transcriptional signatures in plaque macrophages. Human peripheral blood-derived monocytes (PBMCs) differentiated with CXCL4 were characterized in terms of osteogenic signatures and calcifying extracellular vesicle (EV) release. Association of the CXCL4-induced phenotype with the Wnt (wingless-type) pathway was investigated, and CXCL4-induced PBMC-derived EV were analyzed for their calcification potential in ECM (extracellular matrix) hydrogels and their ability to elicit an inflammatory response in vascular smooth muscle cells. In vitro findings were verified histologically in human carotid artery plaques. In human plaque macrophages, single-cell sequencing revealed a CXCL4-susceptible subpopulation bearing a distinct proinflammatory transcriptional signature. CXCL4-differentiated PBMCs exhibited a marked induction of S100A8, MMP7, and osteogenic marker transcription concomitant with augmented release of calcifying EV enriched with MMP7, S100A8, Anx5 (annexin 5), and ALP (alkaline phosphatase). Under osteogenic conditions, PBMCs and their secreted EV independently increased the calcification of the ECM in vitro. Analysis of inflammatory pathway activation identified the Wnt5a-CaMKII (wingless-type 5a-calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) signaling axis to be linked to the CXCL4-induced osteogenic PBMC phenotype, EV calcification potential, and enrichment with MMP7 and S100A8.

Nevertheless, the precise mechanism by which S100A16 operates in myocardial I/R injury remains uncertain. Cardiac I/R injury was produced by ligation/release of the left anterior descending artery, and mouse cardiac cells were subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) to determine the biological effects in vitro. We demonstrated that S100A16 was upregulated in the ischemic hearts and cardiac cells after I/R and H/R injury. Adenovirus-mediated S100A16 inhibition led to a considerable improvement in cardiac function with a reduced infarct size, accompanied by a reduction in cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Similar effects of S100A16 inhibition on inflammation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were observed in cultured cardiomyocytes. Importantly, we showed that I/R and H/R treatment upregulated the expression of voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), which subsequently activated NF-κB/p65 to facilitate the binding of NF-κB/p65 to the S100A16 promoter, thereby activating the transcription and expression of S100A16.

The binding sites for these ligands are usually located at the intracellular N- and C-termini of the TRP channels, and they can demonstrate the character of an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), which allows such a region to bind various types of molecules.

Reelin, an extracellular matrix glycoprotein, regulates neuronal migration and interneuron development. Therefore, we investigated the therapeutic potential of early postnatal reelin treatment in a rat model of MCD induced by prenatal methyazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) exposure at embryonic day 15. The neonatal rats received either recombinant mouse reelin (10 or 2.5 μg/kg) or vehicle once every 2 days from postnatal day (P) 2 to P14. On P15, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-induced spasms were evaluated. The 2.5 μg/kg reelin group showed a significant reduction in the number of NMDA-induced spasms compared with the vehicle group (p = 0.043). Further analyses in the 2.5 μg/kg group revealed increase in the expression of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor 2 (AMPAR2) and calcium/calmodulin-stimulated protein kinase II (CaMKII), and decreased levels of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), AMPAR3, and NMDA receptor 1 (NMDAR1) (p < 0.05). Importantly, a marked increase in cortical interneuron expression was observed, suggesting enhanced inhibitory signaling as a key mechanism for the antispasmodic effect. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging showed no significant changes in cortical metabolites, and Golgi staining showed that dendritic arborization remained unchanged. Behavioral assessments revealed no adverse effects associated with reelin administration. In conclusion, early postnatal reelin treatment effectively suppressed spasm susceptibility in MCD rats, likely through increased interneuron expression and selective modulation of synaptic protein levels. These findings support further investigation of reelin as a potential therapeutic strategy for epilepsy associated with MCD.","Further analyses in the 2.5 μg/kg group revealed increase in the expression of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor 2 (AMPAR2) and calcium/calmodulin-stimulated protein kinase II (CaMKII), and decreased levels of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), AMPAR3, and NMDA receptor 1 (NMDAR1) (p < 0.05)."

The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a vital component that provides structural support and organization to tissues, with matrix stiffness acting as a key regulator of macrophage behavior. Using physiologically relevant 3D stiffening hydrogel models, it is found that increased matrix stiffness alone promoted macrophage polarization toward a pro-regenerative phenotype, mimicking the effect of interleukin-4(IL-4) in softer matrices. Blocking Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2) selectively inhibited stiffness-induced macrophage polarization without affecting IL-4-driven pro-regenerative pathways. In functional studies, CaMKK2 deletion prevented M2-like/pro-tumoral polarization caused by matrix stiffening, which in turn hindered tumor growth. In a murine wound healing model, loss of CaMKK2 impaired matrix stiffness-mediated macrophage accumulation, ultimately disrupting vascularization.

It is a common pathway by which chronic kidney disease can develop into end-stage renal disease, which has high global morbidity and mortality, and there are currently no good therapeutic agents available. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has been indicated to be closely related to the occurrence of renal fibrosis, and its specific inhibitory peptide, autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide (AIP), was shown to directly bind the active site of CaMKII. In this study, we examined the effect of AIP on the progression of renal fibrosis and its possible mechanism. The results showed that AIP could inhibit the expression of the fibrosis markers fibronectin, collagen I, matrix metalloproteinase 2, and <i>α</i>-smooth muscle actin in vivo and in vitro. Further analysis revealed that AIP could inhibit the expression of various epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation-related markers, such as vimentin and Snail 1, in vivo and in vitro.
