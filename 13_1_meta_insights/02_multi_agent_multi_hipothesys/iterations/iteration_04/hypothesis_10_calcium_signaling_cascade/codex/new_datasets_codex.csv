GEO,CAMK2A aging,GSE11475,Rapid encoding of information alters the profile of plasticity related mRNA transcripts in the hippocampal DG region.,Rattus norvegicus,Expression profiling by array,"A theoretical framework for the function of the medial temporal lobe system in memory defines differential contributions of the hippocampal subregions with regard to pattern recognition retrieval processes and encoding of new information. To investigate molecular programs of relevance, we designed a spatial learning protocol to engage a pattern separation function to encode new information. After background training, two groups of animals experienced the same new training in a novel environment, however only one group was provided spatial information and demonstrated spatial memory in a retention test. Global transcriptional analysis of the microdissected subregions of the hippocampus exposed a CA3 pattern that was sufficient to clearly segregate spatial learning animals from control. Individual gene and functional group analysis anchored these results to previous work in neural plasticity. From a multitude of expression changes, increases in camk2a, rasgrp1 and nlgn1 were confirmed by in situ hybridization. Furthermore, siRNA inhibition of nlgn1 within the CA3 subregion impaired spatial memory performance, pointing to mechanisms of synaptic remodeling as a basis for rapid encoding of new information in long-term memory.

GEO,CAMK2A aging,GSE236182,Kdm1a safeguards the topological boundaries of PRC2-repressed genes and prevents aging-related euchromatinization in neurons,Mus musculus,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,"Although Kdm1a is the most expressed histone demethylase in neurons, its molecular function in the adult brain remains unknown. Here, we found that inducible and forebrain-restricted knockout (ifKO) mice, in which Kdm1a is specifically eliminated in forebrain excitatory neurons during adulthood, display a prominent transcriptional and epigenomic dysregulation signature characterized by the neuronal expression of nonneuronal genes. The combination of super-resolution microscopy images and multi-omic analysis integrating transcriptome, epigenome and chromatin conformation data showed that these genes are target of the polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) and locate in H3K27me3-microdomains encapsulated within the euchromatin compartment. Furthermore, functional assays revealed that both the catalytic activity and the N-terminus intrinsically disordered region of Kdm1a, which provides phase separation properties, are needed to maintain the boundaries between these silent micro-domains and the active chromatin environment. As a result, Kdm1a loss led to the spreading of active histone modifications into the PRC2-repressed genes causing their de-repression. Intriguingly, the investigation of aged mice suggested that these boundaries may also weaken during natural aging. Overall, these results underscore the role of Kdm1a safeguarding chromatin compartmentalization, nuclear phase separation and gene silencing in the adult and aging brain.",unknown,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE236182,37,Needs manual gene check
GEO,CAMK2A aging,GSE224423,Translational control by microRNAs is essential for protein homeostatsis in the mouse brain,Mus musculus,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression; however, their contribution to protein homeostasis remains unclear. Impaired protein homeostasis could contribute to brain aging and neurodegeneration; however, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we show that conditional inactivation of Dicer in the adult mouse brain postnatal forebrain causes age-dependent accumulation of lipofuscin and polyubiquitinated protein aggregates. Impaired protein turnover in the cerebral cortex of Dicer conditional knockout (cKO) mice is associated with protein misfolding and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Conditional Drosha inactivation using the same Cre driver results in similar phenotypes, suggesting that the phenotypes may be due to the loss of canonical miRNAs. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed increased expression of target genes of neocortical neuron-enriched miRNAs in the Dicer cKO neocortex and dysregulated expression of genes involved in protein homeostasis maintenance. Further analysis revealed a similar gene expression profile in the hippocampal CA1 region of Dicer cKO mice as in the aging brain. Moreover, translational inhibition using anisomycin or rapamycin ameliorated the protein aggregation and neurodegeneration in Dicer-deficient brains. Thus, protein translational control by miRNAs is an essential component of the protein homeostasis network controlling neuronal survival in the adult brain. Our results show that excessive translation can produce key features of human neurodegenerative diseases, and suggest that translational suppression may be a therapeutic strategy to restore protein homeostasis and combat neurodegeneration.",unknown,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE224423,11,Needs manual gene check
GEO,CAMK2A aging,GSE175946,An NPAS4:NuA4 complex couples synaptic activity to DNA repair [ChIP-Seq],Mus musculus,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,"Neuronal activity is critical for adaptive circuit remodeling but poses an inherent risk to the stability of the genome across the long lifespan of post-mitotic neurons. Whether neurons have acquired specialized genome protection mechanisms that enable them to withstand decades of potentially damaging stimuli during periods of heightened activity is not known. Here we identify the first example of a neuronal-specific DNA repair mechanism via a new form of the NuA4/TIP60 chromatin modifier that assembles in activated neurons around the inducible, neuronal-specific transcription factor NPAS4. We purify this complex directly from the brain and demonstrate its function in eliciting activity-dependent changes to neuronal transcriptomes and neuronal circuitry. NPAS4:NuA4 binds at fragile regulatory regions that undergo neuronal activity-induced DNA double-strand breaks and recruits additional DNA repair machinery to stimulate the repair of these sites. Gene regulatory elements bound by the NPAS4:NuA4 complex are partially protected from age-dependent accumulation of somatic mutations. Impaired NPAS4:NuA4 signaling leads to a cascade of cellular defects including dysregulated transcriptional responses to activity, loss of control over neuronal inhibition, and genome instability, culminating in reduced longevity at the organismal level. In addition, mutations in several components of the NuA4 complex are reported to lead to neurodevelopmental disorders and autism. Together, these findings identify a neuronal-specific complex that couples neuronal activity directly to genome preservation and whose disruption may contribute to developmental disorders, neurodegeneration and aging.",unknown,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE175946,12,Needs manual gene check

GEO,calcium signaling aging,GSE295369,Parallel gene expression changes in ventral midbrain dopamine and GABA neurons during normal aging,Mus musculus,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,"The consequences of aging can vary dramatically between different brain regions and cell types. In the ventral midbrain, dopaminergic neurons develop physiological deficits with normal aging that likely convey susceptibility to neurodegeneration. While nearby GABAergic neurons are thought to be more resilient, decreased GABA signaling in other areas nonetheless correlates with age-related cognitive decline and the development of degenerative diseases. Here, we used two novel cell type-specific Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification models to elucidate the impact of healthy brain aging on the molecular profiles of dopamine and GABA neurons in the ventral midbrain. By analyzing differential gene expression from young adult (7-10 month) and old (21-24 month) mice, we detected commonalities in the aging process in both neuronal types, including increased inflammatory responses and upregulation of pro-survival pathways. Both cell types also showed downregulation of genes involved in synaptic connectivity and plasticity. Genes involved in serotonergic signaling were upregulated with age only in GABA neurons and not dopamine-releasing cells. In contrast, dopaminergic neurons showed alterations in genes connected with mitochondrial function and calcium signaling, which were markedly downregulated in male mice. Sex differences were detected in both neuron types, but in general were more prominent in dopamine neurons. Multiple sex effects correlated with the differential prevalence for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s seen in humans. In summary, these results provide insight into the connection between non-pathological aging and susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases involving the ventral midbrain, and identify molecular phenotypes that could underlie homeostatic maintenance during normal aging.",unknown,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE295369,37,Needs manual gene check
GEO,calcium signaling aging,GSE288007,fmo-4 promotes longevity and stress resistance via ER to mitochondria calcium regulation in C. elegans,Caenorhabditis elegans,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,"Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are a conserved family of xenobiotic enzymes upregulated in multiple longevity interventions, including nematode and mouse models. Previous work supports that C. elegans fmo-2 promotes longevity, stress resistance, and healthspan by rewiring endogenous metabolism. However, there are five C. elegans FMOs and five mammalian FMOs, and it is not known whether promoting longevity and health benefits is a conserved role of this gene family. Here, we report that expression of C. elegans fmo-4 promotes lifespan extension and paraquat stress resistance downstream of both dietary restriction and inhibition of mTOR. We find that overexpression of fmo-4 in just the hypodermis is sufficient for these benefits, and that this expression significantly modifies the transcriptome. By analyzing changes in gene expression, we find that genes related to calcium signaling are significantly altered downstream of fmo-4 expression. Highlighting the importance of calcium homeostasis in this pathway, fmo-4 overexpressing animals are sensitive to thapsigargin, an ER stressor that inhibits calcium flux from the cytosol to the ER lumen. This calcium/fmo-4 interaction is solidified by data showing that modulating intracellular calcium with either small molecules or genetics can change expression of fmo-4 and/or interact with fmo-4 to affect lifespan and stress resistance. Further analysis supports a pathway where fmo-4 modulates calcium homeostasis downstream of activating transcription factor-6 (atf-6), whose knockdown induces and requires fmo-4 expression. Together, our data identify fmo-4 as a longevity- promoting gene whose actions interact with known longevity pathways and calcium homeostasis.",unknown,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE288007,6,Needs manual gene check
GEO,calcium signaling aging,GSE288320,TRPC1 links calcium signaling to cellular senescence in the protection against post-traumatic osteoarthritis,Mus musculus,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,"Transient receptor potential channel 1 (TRPC1) is a widely expressed mechanosensitive ion channel located within the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, crucial for refilling depleted internal calcium stores during activation of calcium-dependent signaling pathways. Here, we have demonstrated that TRPC1 activity is protective within cartilage homeostasis in the prevention of cellular senescence associated cartilage breakdown during mechanical and inflammatory challenge. We revealed that TRPC1 loss is associated with early stages of osteoarthritis (OA) and plays a non-redundant role in calcium signaling in chondrocytes. Trpc1-/- mice subjected to destabilization of the medial meniscus induced OA developed a more severe OA phenotype than wild type controls. During early OA development, Trpc1-/- mice displayed an increased chondrocyte survival rate, however remaining cells displayed features of senescence including p16INK4a expression and decreased Sox9. RNA sequencing identified differentially expressed genes related to cell number, apoptosis and extracellular matrix organization. Trpc1-/- chondrocytes exhibited accelerated dedifferentiation, while demonstrating an increased susceptibility to cellular senescence. Targeting the mechanism of TRPC1 activation may be a promising therapeutic strategy in osteoarthritis prevention.",unknown,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE288320,7,Needs manual gene check
GEO,calcium signaling aging,GSE262229,Chronic stress promotes intestinal stem cell aging [scRNA-seq],Mus musculus,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,"To elucidate alterations in intestinal cell types under chronic stress, we conducted scRNA-seq analysis of intestinal crypts from NT and ES models. After that, we found that significant changes in ISCs in the ES group compared to the NT group. To validate the functional roles of ISCs, we performed RNA-seq of ISCs under different treatment conditions, we identified Chrm3-dependent differential genes between NT and ES groups, particularly noting downregulated genes associated with stemness and proliferation (e.g., Olfm4, Lgr5, and Mcm4), and upregulated genes linked to aging and calcium signaling pathways (e.g., Cdkn1a, Orai1, and Chp2), which contribute to ISC aging. These findings provided mechanistic insights into targeting these pathways to enhance intestinal function and integrity. Furthermore, to assess the impact of stress-induced changes in microbiota composition on ISC stemness, we synchronized microbiota between NT and ES groups through co-housing conditions and employed 16S rDNA sequencing. This analysis aimed to ascertain the possibility that changes in the microbiota composition whether contribute to the decline in ISC stemness under stress conditions. scRNA-seq of crypts were used to to characterize the diversity of cell lines under chronic stress. RNA-seq of ISC in Chrm3Lgr5+/+ and Chrm3Lgr5-/- mice from NT and ES mice were taken to delineate altered pathways and the mechanisms underlying ISC changes in ES model. 16S rDNA-seq (available in PRJNA1090629) were employed to confirm microbiota synchronization between NT and ES groups under co-housing conditions.",unknown,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE262229,2,Needs manual gene check

GEO,calmodulin aging,GSE198526,Conserved reduction of m6A marks during aging and neurodegeneration is linked to altered translation of synaptic transcripts,Mus musculus,Other,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) plays diverse roles in the regulation of mRNA metabolism. In the mammalian brain it has been linked to developmental processes, memory function and plasticity. However, the precise role of m6A in the context synaptic plasticity and especially during impaired cognition are not fully understood. Here, we describe the mouse and human brain m6A epi-transcriptome in a tissue-specific manner. We furthermore show that m6A levels undergo massive decreases across mouse brain regions as a consequence of aging. Equally, Alzheimer’s disease in humans correlates with decreased N6-methylation in a similar population of transcripts that are linked to synaptic function and localized to synapses, such as the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). In line with this we show that reduced m6A levels impair synaptic protein-synthesis of CAMKII. Our results suggest that N6-RNA-methylation is an important mechanism to control synaptic protein synthesis which is affected early in cognitive diseases.

The different NFAT family members can have overlapping functions but also are now known to exhibit distinct functions in T cells and can influence host tolerance. In the current study, we investigated for the first time the role played by the calcineurin B (Cnb1) signaling in CD4 T cells. We generated mice that lack selectively Cnb1 in CD4 T cells (Cnb1CD4 mice) and analyzed the immune phenotype during the ageing and in vitro studies. Disruption of CnB signal in CD4 T cells was associated with an increase of IFNγ- and IL-17-secreting cells. Antibiotic treatment reverted the spontaneous intestinal inflammation observed in Cnb1CD4 mice, indicating that microbiota is the main factor involved in colitis onset.
