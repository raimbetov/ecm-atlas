SERPINE1,Serpine1-/- mouse,10.1172/jci116893,"Knockout mice exhibit enhanced fibrinolysis with resistance to venous thrombosis but show prolonged bleeding and delayed clot stabilization, indicating significant but non-lethal hemostatic disruption.",Moderate,Loss of PAI-1 shifts balance toward fibrinolysis; viable adults with altered thrombosis susceptibility.
SERPINC1,SerpinC1 hypomorphic mouse (antithrombin insufficiency),10.1038/ki.2015.176,"Partial deficiency markedly worsens renal ischemia/reperfusion injury, leading to microvascular thrombosis, renal failure, and increased mortality after insult.",High,"Antithrombin insufficiency sensitises mice to thrombo-inflammatory organ damage, supporting critical protective role."
SERPINB6,Serpinb6a-/- mouse,10.1016/j.ajpath.2013.03.009,"Knockout leads to progressive sensorineural hearing loss with hair cell degeneration and spiral ganglion pathology, indicating essential protective role in inner ear.",Moderate,Loss triggers cochlear cell death and auditory dysfunction without systemic lethality.
SERPINF1,Human recessive loss-of-function,10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.01.015,"Biallelic truncating variants cause osteogenesis imperfecta type VI with severe bone fragility, vertebral compressions, and impaired mineralization.",High,Demonstrates essential role of PEDF/SERPINF1 in bone matrix maturation; human phenotype severe and debilitating.
