# Biomarker Feasibility (Agent: codex)

## Summary
All eight ensemble-selected proteins are detectable in blood or minimally invasive specimens. Seven map directly to plasma/serum assays; FBLN5 is predominantly tissue/extracellular but measurable in circulation at lower abundance with ultrasensitive assays. No candidate requires novel chemistry beyond established immunoassay or targeted MS workflows.

## Panel Review
- **FSTL1 (Follistatin-like 1):** Secreted glycoprotein released by vascular and stromal cells; serum ELISAs validated in cardiovascular and fibrosis cohorts (ng/mL range). Stable in EDTA plasma with standard cold-chain.
- **S100A9 (Calprotectin subunit):** Abundant neutrophil alarmin; widely deployed as fecal/serum inflammatory marker. Numerous FDA-cleared immunoassays; dynamic range accommodates aging-related upregulation.
- **CTSA (Cathepsin A):** Lysosomal serine carboxypeptidase that co-secretes in exosomes and circulates bound to fibrinogen. Quantifiable via sandwich ELISA or LC-MS/MS; requires heparin plasma to minimize in vitro activation.
- **CELA3A/B (Pancreatic elastases):** Pancreatic digestive enzymes secreted into circulation; fecal elastase kits already standard. Serum detection via fluorogenic elastase assays or targeted proteomics; elevations reported in pancreatic insufficiency and systemic inflammation.
- **IL17D:** Cytokine family member secreted by stromal cells; commercially available multiplex cytokine panels include IL-17D with pg/mL sensitivity. Requires serum-freezing within 2 h to preserve integrity.
- **F13B (Coagulation factor XIII B subunit):** Plasma zymogen measured in coagulation panels; chromogenic and immunoturbidimetric assays routine. Hemolysis interferes slightlyâ€”collect citrate plasma.
- **GAS6 (Growth arrest-specific 6):** Vitamin K-dependent secreted ligand; robust ELISAs and chemiluminescent assays exist (cardiometabolic risk marker). Samples should avoid warfarin-treated patients unless interpreted cautiously.
- **FBLN5 (Fibulin-5):** Elastic fiber organizer; highest in tissues but detectable in serum of fibrotic and vascular patients using high-sensitivity ELISA (<50 pg/mL LoD). Consider paired tissue imaging or soluble fragment quantitation for confirmation.

## Logistics & QC
- Preferred matrix: paired serum + EDTA plasma to balance coagulation vs cytokine stability.
- Batch QC: Include pooled-aging control plasma; run duplicate wells for low-abundance candidates (FBLN5, IL17D).
- Normalisation: Apply internal standards (e.g., spiked peptides) for MS workflows; for ELISA use calibrator curves covering at least three logs.
- Regulatory outlook: All proteins except FBLN5 already have RUO or clinical-grade kits, easing translation into CLIA lab-developed tests.
