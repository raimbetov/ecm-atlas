# Therapeutic Strategy Guide (Agent: codex)

## Clinical Interpretation Framework
- **Risk Stratification:** Calculate fast-aging probability via ensemble; values >0.6 trigger intervention review. Combine with absolute |Δz| velocity to prioritise tissue-focused monitoring (lung, skeletal muscle, dermis).
- **Biomarker Clusters:**
  1. **Coagulation / Thrombo-inflammation (F13B, GAS6, S100A9):** Indicates pro-thrombotic milieu; escalate anticoagulation vigilance and anti-inflammatory regimens.
  2. **Matrix Remodeling & Elasticity (FSTL1, FBLN5, CELA3A/B, CTSA):** Signals extracellular matrix turnover; favour anti-fibrotic and ECM-support therapies.
  3. **Immune Modulation (IL17D, S100A9):** Reflects innate immune activation; consider cytokine-modulating or senomorphic strategies.

## Intervention Playbook
- **Coagulation Control:**
  - Elevated F13B + GAS6 → screen for hypercoagulability; consider low-dose DOACs or heparinoids if clinically indicated.
  - S100A9 surge aligns with neutrophil-driven NETosis; integrate colchicine or targeted anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., IL-1β blockers) to reduce thromboinflammatory burden.
- **ECM Stabilisation:**
  - High FSTL1 / low FBLN5 signals elastin fragmentation; evaluate TGF-β modulators, LOX-activating supplements, or mechanical unloading protocols for musculoskeletal tissues.
  - CELA3A/B elevation suggests protease dominance; explore serine protease inhibitors (aprotinin analogues) or diet-driven pancreatic support.
  - CTSA increase denotes lysosomal stress—test cathepsin inhibitors or autophagy enhancers (trehalose, rapalogs) under clinical supervision.
- **Immune Tuning:**
  - IL17D + S100A9 cluster → candidate for anti-IL17/anti-IL23 therapeutics (secukinumab class) or senescent cell clearance to dampen inflammaging.

## Monitoring & Feedback
- **Testing cadence:** Quarterly during intervention titration, biannually once stable. Pair with functional endpoints (6-minute walk, lung diffusion capacity, skin elasticity assays).
- **Success indicators:** ≥20% reduction in ensemble fast-aging probability; convergence of FSTL1, S100A9, GAS6 toward slow-aging cohort medians.
- **Fallback actions:** If probability remains >0.7 despite interventions, escalate to multi-omics panel (transcriptomics, metabolomics) or targeted imaging (elastography, vascular ultrasound) for localized therapy.

## Research Extensions
- Combine panel with ECM-targeted therapeutics (e.g., pentraxin-3 mimetics) in clinical trials.
- Use GAS6/FSTL1 dynamics as pharmacodynamic readouts for regenerative treatments (stem-cell secretome, senolytics).
- Investigate causal ordering via longitudinal sampling—does protease surge precede coagulation drift or vice versa?
