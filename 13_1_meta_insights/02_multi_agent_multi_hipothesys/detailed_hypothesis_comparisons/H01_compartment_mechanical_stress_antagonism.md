# H01: Compartment Mechanical Stress Antagonism

## Hypothesis Statement

*[Extracted from task files]*

## Claude Code Results

- **Status:** BREAKTHROUGH (Score: 96.0/100)
- **Thesis:** Analysis of 3,161 ECM protein measurements across 16 tissue compartments reveals 1,254 antagonistic protein-compartment pairs (top magnitude: 8.85 SD for CILP2), but statistical testing rejects the mechanical stress hypothesis as neither high-load compartments show higher structural protein upregulation (Mann-Whitney p=0.98) nor does mechanical stress correlate with aging trajectories (Spearman œÅ=-0.055, p=0.37), indicating that compartment antagonism exists but is not driven by biomechanical lo...
