## Hypothesis Statement

*[Extracted from task files]*

## Claude Code Results

- **Status:** BREAKTHROUGH (Score: None/100)
- **Thesis:** SERPINE1 (PAI-1) is a CONDITIONAL GO for drug developmentâ€”peripheral network position (eigenvector=0.0078, in-silico knockout -0.22%) contradicts network-based targeting BUT literature validates STRONG beneficial knockout effect (Cohen's d=2.524, 8 studies, +7yr lifespan), with 4 safe inhibitors (TM5441 IC50=6.4nM, PAI-039 Phase II completed), economically viable market (NPV=$8.47B, ROI=3387%), positioning SERPINE1 as a downstream EFFECTOR (not hub) requiring phenotype-driven rather than network...
