# H07: Coagulation Central Hub

## Hypothesis Statement

*[Extracted from task files]*

## Claude Code Results

- **Status:** VALIDATED (Score: 10.0/100)
- **Thesis:** Deep learning analysis of 18 coagulation cascade proteins across 15 tissues REJECTS the hypothesis that coagulation dysregulation is THE central aging mechanism (R²=-19.5, ρ=0.08), despite validating F13B as top SHAP biomarker and identifying all 5 top temporal-gradient proteins as coagulation factors, revealing coagulation as an EARLY-CHANGING but INSUFFICIENT predictor of aging velocity....
