# H14: Serpin Centrality Resolution

## Hypothesis Statement

*[Extracted from task files]*

## Claude Code Results

- **Status:** VALIDATED (Score: None/100)
- **Thesis:** Eigenvector centrality (ρ=0.929) and degree (ρ=0.997) predict knockout impact, not betweenness (ρ=0.033), resolving H02 disagreement in favor of Codex; serpins are moderately central hubs (6/13 serpins <20th percentile eigenvector, consensus rank: 16-60th percentile) with protective aging phenotype (SERPINE1 knockout +7yr lifespan) indicating downstream regulatory role....
