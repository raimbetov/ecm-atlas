# H03: Tissue Aging Velocity Clocks

## Hypothesis Statement

*[Extracted from task files]*

## Claude Code Results

- **Status:** VALIDATED (Score: 92.0/100)
- **Thesis:** Tissues exhibit distinct aging velocities ranging 4-fold (1.02-4.29 |Δz|), with lung aging fastest (4.29) and tubulointerstitial slowest (1.02), driven by tissue-specific ECM markers (273 proteins, TSI>3.0) but NOT by differential inflammatory signatures (p=0.41), refuting metabolic stress hypothesis....

## Codex Results

- **Status:** UNKNOWN (Score: None/100)
- **Thesis:** Lung and fast-contracting skeletal muscles show the steepest ECM aging velocities, with tissue-specific markers and shared coagulation–remodeling proteins clarifying mechanisms and therapeutic priorities across four analytical lenses....
