# H18: Multi-Modal AI Integration

## Hypothesis Statement

*[Extracted from task files]*

## Claude Code Results

- **Status:** REJECTED (Score: None/100)
- **Thesis:** Multimodal deep learning integration (AE+GNN+LSTM+S100) attempted on ECM aging dataset (18 samples, 910 proteins) revealed fundamental data limitation: with only 12 training samples, best model (AE+LSTM) achieved Test R²≈0 and MAE=0.47, demonstrating that architectural sophistication cannot overcome extreme data scarcity; hypothesis H18.1 (R²>0.85) conclusively rejected due to sample size <<100 minimum for deep learning....
