# H02: Serpin Cascade Dysregulation

## Hypothesis Statement

*[Extracted from task files]*

## Claude Code Results

- **Status:** VALIDATED (Score: 65.0/100)
- **Thesis:** Comprehensive analysis of 72 serpins across ECM aging datasets reveals significant dysregulation (median |Δz|=0.37 vs 0.33 non-serpins) and multi-pathway involvement (5 pathways, 27 inflammation serpins), but network centrality analysis shows serpins are NOT preferentially positioned as hubs (7.1% of hubs vs 7.6% baseline, 0.93x enrichment, p=0.96), contradicting the hypothesis that serpins function as central regulatory nodes of ECM aging cascades....

## Codex Results

- **Status:** VALIDATED (Score: None/100)
- **Thesis:** Serpin cascade dysregulation emerges as the dominant ECM aging hub because serpins outpace non-serpins in magnitude, persist across tissues, occupy high-impact network positions, and enable targeted therapeutic leverage (Sections 1.0–4.0)....
