Discovery_Type,Protein,Metric,Description
Weak_Signal_Explosion,394 proteins,+2714.3% increase,"Batch correction revealed 394 weak signal proteins (|Δz|=0.3-0.8) vs 14 in V1, suggesting previously masked subtle but widespread ECM remodeling"
Tissue_Specificity_Expansion,386 proteins,+2869.2% increase (TSI>3.0),"Batch correction uncovered 386 tissue-specific proteins vs 13 in V1, indicating tissue-specific aging patterns were previously suppressed by batch effects"
New_Universal_Marker,LRG1,Top-3 universality,"LRG1 (Leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1) emerged in top-3 universal markers, not in V1 top-5, plasma acute-phase protein linked to inflammation"
New_Universal_Marker,FCN2,Top-3 universality,"FCN2 (Ficolin-2) emerged in top-3 universal markers, not in V1 top-5, innate immunity lectin pathway protein"
New_Top_TSI,CLEC14A,Highest TSI in V2,"CLEC14A (C-type lectin domain family 14 member A) displaced KDM5C as highest tissue-specificity protein, endothelial-specific aging marker"
PCOLCE_Weakening,PCOLCE,Δz=-0.36 vs -0.82 (V1),"PCOLCE depletion signal weakened 56% in batch-corrected data, questioning paradigm strength (REJECTED classification)"
TIMP3_Weakening,TIMP3,Δz=+1.53 vs +3.14 (V1),"TIMP3 accumulation halved after batch correction, suggesting V1 signal was partially batch-driven artifact"
Species_Correlation_Reversal,Human-Mouse,R=+0.95 vs -0.71 (V1),"Cross-species correlation REVERSED from negative to positive, but only 5 shared genes (insufficient for confident conclusion)"
Compartment_Data_Loss,Multi-compartment tissues,0 tissues in V2,"Batch correction process lost compartment-level granularity, preventing validation of antagonistic remodeling insight (G6)"
Weak_Signal_Therapeutic_Window,394 proteins in 0.3-0.8 range,Pathway-level cumulative effect,"Suggests broader therapeutic targeting opportunity: 28x more proteins show subtle persistent changes amenable to early intervention"
