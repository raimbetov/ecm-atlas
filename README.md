The extracellular matrix is a complex substance found within the confines of the intercellular tissue space. Besides providing anchoring support, the extracellular matrix, secreted and assembled by resident cells, is a mechanical and biochemical environment that directs cellular functions and processes via a collection of various stimuli, prompting gene expression profiles to reflect developmental and physiological contexts. Being a dynamic structure, the extracellular matrix composition is subject to change as a function of pathology and age. Presently, there is a lack of a unified consensual understanding of the qualitative and quantitative aspects of said age-related compositional changes on a tissue/organ level. Herein, I describe a database that aggregates published proteomic datasets on extracellular matrix aging signatures with a tissue-level granularity, allowing direct comparison of matrisomal protein abundances across different compartments and methodologies.
