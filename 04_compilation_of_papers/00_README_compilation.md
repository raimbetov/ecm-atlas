# Paper Analysis Compilation

**Date Created:** 2025-10-12
**Purpose:** Synthesize best analysis from Claude Code and Codex CLI agents into single authoritative file per paper

---

## üìã Overview

This folder contains **comprehensive analyses** for all 11 ECM Atlas papers, synthesizing information from:

1. **Original paper analyses** (`knowledge_base/01_paper_analysis/`)
2. **Claude Code age bin analyses** (`03_age_bin_paper_focus/claude_code/`)
3. **Codex CLI age bin analyses** (`03_age_bin_paper_focus/codex_cli/`)
4. **Claude Code updated papers** (`03_age_bin_paper_focus/claude_code/paper_analyses_updated/`)
5. **Codex CLI updated papers** (`03_age_bin_paper_focus/codex_cli/paper_analyses_updated/`)

## üéØ Compilation Methodology

### Agent Accuracy Context
- **Claude Code:** 13/13 criteria (100% accuracy) - correctly identified RNA-Seq studies
- **Codex CLI:** 12/13 criteria (92% accuracy) - misclassified Chmelova 2023 (RNA-Seq as LFQ)

### Selection Criteria (Per Paper)

**For Chmelova 2023:**
- ‚úÖ Use **Claude Code** exclusively (Codex made fatal classification error)

**For All Other Papers:**
- Compare both agents' analyses
- Select **best column mapping** (most detailed, clear source documentation)
- Select **best age bin strategy** (clearest biological reasoning)
- Synthesize **best implementation notes**
- Document any conflicts or differences

## üìÅ File Inventory (11 Papers)

### LFQ Studies (5 papers - Phase 1 Ready)
| # | Study | Species | Tissue | Method | Age Normalization |
|---|-------|---------|--------|--------|-------------------|
| 01 | Angelidis 2019 | Mouse | Lung | MaxQuant LFQ | Already binary (3mo, 24mo) |
| 05 | Dipali 2023 | Mouse | Ovary | DirectDIA | Already binary (6-12wk, 10-12mo) |
| 06 | LiDermis 2021 | Human | Dermis | Label-free LC-MS/MS | 4‚Üí2 groups (exclude 40yr) |
| 09 | Randles 2021 | Human | Kidney | Progenesis Hi-N | Already binary (young, old) |
| 10 | Tam 2020 | Human | Spine | MaxQuant LFQ | Already binary (16yr, 59yr) |

### Non-LFQ Studies (5 papers - Deferred to Phase 3)
| # | Study | Species | Tissue | Method | Status |
|---|-------|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| 02 | Ariosa 2021 | Mouse | Brain | SILAC (isotope) | Deferred |
| 03 | Caldeira 2017 | Cow | Multiple | iTRAQ (isobaric) | Deferred |
| 07 | LiPancreas 2021 | Human | Pancreas | DiLeu (isobaric) | Deferred |
| 08 | Ouni 2022 | Mouse | Adipose | TMTpro (isobaric) | Deferred |
| 11 | Tsumagari 2023 | Mouse | Brain | TMTpro (isobaric) | Deferred |

### RNA-Seq Study (1 paper - Permanently Excluded)
| # | Study | Species | Tissue | Method | Status |
|---|-------|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| 04 | Chmelova 2023 | Mouse | Brain | **RNA-Seq (transcriptomics)** | **EXCLUDED** |

## üîç Key Decisions Documented

### Chmelova 2023 Classification Error
- **Codex CLI:** Incorrectly classified as "MaxQuant LFQ (Orbitrap)"
- **Claude Code:** Correctly identified as "RNA-Seq" (transcriptomics)
- **Evidence:** Original paper analysis line 26: "Method: RNA-Seq"
- **Impact:** Would have contaminated proteomics atlas with transcriptomics data
- **Decision:** Use Claude Code analysis exclusively; mark Codex as erroneous

### Age Bin Normalization Approach
- **Conservative strategy:** Exclude middle-aged groups (not combine with young/old)
- **Species-specific cutoffs:**
  - Mouse: young ‚â§4mo, old ‚â•18mo (lifespan ~24-30mo)
  - Human: young ‚â§30yr, old ‚â•55yr (lifespan ~75-85yr)
  - Cow: young ‚â§3yr, old ‚â•15yr
- **Data retention threshold:** ‚â•66% samples retained after normalization

## üìä Comprehensive File Structure

Each comprehensive analysis file contains:

### For LFQ Studies:
```
# [Study] - Comprehensive Analysis

## 1. Paper Overview
- Basic metadata (title, PMID, tissue, species, ages)

## 2. Method Classification & Quality Control
- LFQ compatibility verification
- Agent comparison (if differences exist)
- Final verdict

## 3. Age Bin Normalization Strategy
- Original age groups
- Normalization approach (conservative exclusion)
- Data retention calculation
- Final young/old mapping

## 4. Column Mapping to 13-Column Schema
- Complete mapping table
- Source file identification
- Mapping gaps and solutions
- Best practices from both agents

## 5. Parsing Implementation Guide
- Source file details (path, sheet, dimensions)
- Sample_ID format templates
- Preprocessing steps (if required)
- Expected output row counts
- Ready for parsing: YES/NO

## 6. Quality Assurance Notes
- Known limitations
- Biological considerations
- Cross-study comparisons
```

### For Non-LFQ Studies:
```
# [Study] - Comprehensive Analysis

## 1. Paper Overview
## 2. Method Classification
- Why excluded (isobaric/isotope labeling)
## 3. Deferred to Phase 3
- Future normalization strategy
- Column mapping preserved for reference
## 4. Notes
```

## üéì Usage Guidelines

### For Phase 2 Parsing (LFQ Studies)
1. **Start with:** 01_Angelidis, 09_Randles, 10_Tam (binary design, no preprocessing)
2. **Then:** 05_Dipali (after age metadata confirmation)
3. **Finally:** 06_LiDermis (requires Adult 40yr filtering + UniProt enrichment)

### For Phase 3 Planning (Non-LFQ Studies)
- Reference these comprehensive analyses when designing isobaric/isotope normalization strategies
- Column mappings preserved for future use

### For Exclusions
- **04_Chmelova:** Do NOT include in any proteomics analysis (RNA-Seq, non-proteomic)

## üîó Source Traceability

Each comprehensive file documents:
- Which agent's analysis was used for each section
- Rationale for selection (better detail, clearer mapping, correct classification)
- Any conflicts between agents and resolution
