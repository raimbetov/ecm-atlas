## Overview

This folder contains comprehensive validation of the **Angelidis_2019** dataset's data scale (LINEAR vs LOG2) and provides definitive recommendations for batch correction preprocessing.

### Key Finding

**Data in ECM-Atlas database is in LOG2 SCALE**

- Source: MaxQuant LFQ intensities (pre-processed by authors as log2)
- Database median: 28.52 (≈ log2(369M intensity units))
- Processing: NO additional transformation applied
- Batch correction: Use directly, DO NOT apply log2(x+1)

## Quick Reference

### Question 1: What scale does MaxQuant LFQ output?
**Answer:** LINEAR intensity values (tens of millions to billions)  
**Evidence:** MaxQuant documentation, paper Methods

### Question 2: Was log2 transformation applied during processing?
**Answer:** NO - Scripts pass values directly from Excel  
**Evidence:** grep search found NO transformation code

### Question 3: What scale is in the merged database?
**Answer:** LOG2 (median 28.52 ≈ log2(369M))  
**Evidence:** Data inspection, statistical analysis

### Question 4: Should we apply log2(x+1) for batch correction?
**Answer:** NO - Do NOT apply (already log2, would double-log)  
**Recommendation:** Use directly for ComBat algorithm

## For Batch Correction Implementation

### Current State
- Angelidis_2019: 291 ECM proteins × 8 samples (4 young, 4 old)
- Data scale: LOG2
- Z-scores: Already calculated
- Action needed: Apply batch correction at abundance level, recalculate z-scores

### Recommended Workflow

```python
# Step 1: Load abundance data (already log2)
abundance = load_angelidis_abundance()  # Shape: (291, 8)

# Step 2: Create batch indicators
batch = ['batch1']*4 + ['batch2']*4  # Or by tissue, study, etc.

# Step 3: Apply ComBat (for log2-scale data)
from combat.pycombat import pycombat
abundance_corrected = pycombat(abundance, batch)

# Step 4: Recalculate z-scores
zscore = (abundance_corrected - mean) / std

# WRONG: Do NOT do this
# abundance_log2_again = np.log2(abundance)  # Double logging!
```

### DO's and DON'Ts

**DO:**
- Use log2 data directly for ComBat ✓
- Apply ComBat before z-scoring ✓
- Recalculate z-scores after batch correction ✓
- Document data scale in metadata ✓

**DON'T:**
- Apply log2(x+1) transformation ✗ (already log2)
- Use ComBat-Seq on log2 data ✗ (expects counts)
- Apply batch correction to z-scores ✗ (use abundance first)
- Skip documentation of scale ✗ (critical for reproducibility)

| Excel file scale | LOG2 | HIGH |
| Processing transformation | NONE | HIGH |
| Database scale | LOG2 | HIGH |
| Should apply log2(x+1) | NO | HIGH |

- [x] Data values analyzed (24.5-37.7 = log2 range)
- [x] Excel file verified (pre-processed supplementary data)
- [x] Statistical distribution checked (log-normal typical of LC-MS)
- [x] Physical reasonableness verified (2^28.5 ≈ 369M ✓)

## Risk Management

### Risk: Double-Logging
**Severity:** HIGH - Would corrupt batch corrections  
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM - If scale not documented  
**Mitigation:** All 3 documents + code comments + metadata tags

### Risk: Mixed Scales Across Studies
**Severity:** HIGH - Incompatible batch corrections  
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM - Depends on other studies  
**Mitigation:** Validate scale for each study before batch correction

### Risk: Z-Scores Calculated Before Batch Correction
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Loses biological signal  
**Likelihood:** LOW - If workflow is documented  
**Mitigation:** Clear SOP in batch correction framework
