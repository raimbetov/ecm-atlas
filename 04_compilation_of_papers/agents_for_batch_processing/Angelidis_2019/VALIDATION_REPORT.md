## PHASE 1: Paper and Methods Section

### Source Document
- **File:** `/Users/Kravtsovd/projects/ecm-atlas/pdf/Angelidis et al. - 2019.pdf`
- **Study:** "An atlas of the aging lung mapped by single cell transcriptomics and deep tissue proteomics"
- **Citation:** Nature Communications (2019) 10:963

### Methods Section - Proteomics Quantification

#### Exact Quote from Methods (Page 14):

> **"Mass spectrometry data were acquired on a Quadrupole/Orbitrap type Mass Spectrometer (Q-Exactive, Thermo Scientific) as previously described. Approximately 2 μg of peptides were separated in a 4 h gradient on a 50 cm long (75 μm inner diameter) column packed in-house with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9 μm resin (Dr. Maisch GmbH). Reverse-phase chromatography was performed with an EASY-nLC 1000 ultra-high pressure system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), which was coupled to a Q-Exactive Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific)... MS raw files were analyzed by the MaxQuant (version 1.4.3.20) and peak lists were searched against the human Uniprot FASTA database (version Nov 2016), and a common contaminants database (247 entries) by the Andromeda search engine as previously described. ...For label-free quantification in MaxQuant the minimum ratio count was set to two."**

#### Key Technical Details:

1. **MaxQuant Version:** 1.4.3.20
2. **Quantification Method:** Label-free quantification (LFQ)
3. **Data Processing:** Default MaxQuant pipeline
4. **No explicit log2 transformation mentioned in Methods**

### Critical Finding: MaxQuant LFQ Output Format

From MaxQuant documentation and common practice:
- **MaxQuant LFQ Intensity = LINEAR intensity values**
- MaxQuant outputs "Intensity" columns as LINEAR (not log2)
- However, the supplementary data file provided in Nature Communications shows pre-processed intensities

## PHASE 2: Processing Scripts Analysis

### Script Location
- **Main Script:** `/Users/Kravtsovd/projects/ecm-atlas/05_papers_to_csv/09_Angelidis_2019_paper_to_csv/parse_angelidis.py`
- **Conversion Script:** `/Users/Kravtsovd/projects/ecm-atlas/05_papers_to_csv/09_Angelidis_2019_paper_to_csv/convert_to_wide.py`

### Key Code Excerpts

#### Configuration (parse_angelidis.py, lines 13-28):
```python
CONFIG = {
    "study_id": "Angelidis_2019",
    "data_file": "data_raw/Angelidis et al. - 2019/41467_2019_8831_MOESM5_ESM.xlsx",
    "sheet_name": "Proteome",
    "method": "Label-free LC-MS/MS (MaxQuant LFQ)",
    "young_age": 3,
    "old_age": 24,
    ...
    "Abundance_Unit": "LFQ_intensity",
    "Parsing_Notes": "Age={CONFIG['young_age']}mo from column '{col}'; 
                      LFQ intensity from MaxQuant; C57BL/6J cohorts"
}
```

#### Processing Logic (parse_angelidis.py, lines 117-122):
```python
'Abundance': row[col],
'Abundance_Unit': 'LFQ_intensity',
'Method': CONFIG['method'],
```

### Critical Finding: NO Log2 Transformation Applied

**Search Results:**
- Pattern: `log2` - **NOT FOUND** in processing scripts
- Pattern: `log(` - **NOT FOUND** in processing scripts  
- Pattern: `np.log` - **NOT FOUND** in processing scripts
- Pattern: `transformation` - **NOT FOUND**

**Conclusion:** Raw LFQ intensities are passed directly without any logarithmic transformation.

## PHASE 3: Source Data Inspection

### Source File
- **File:** `/Users/Kravtsovd/projects/ecm-atlas/data_raw/Angelidis et al. - 2019/41467_2019_8831_MOESM5_ESM.xlsx`
- **Sheet:** "Proteome"
- **Rows:** 5,213 proteins
- **Samples:** 8 (4 young, 4 old)

### Sample Raw Data Values

#### First 10 ECM Proteins (from Angelidis_2019_wide_format.csv):

| Protein_ID | Gene_Symbol | Abundance_Young | Abundance_Old | Interpretation |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| A0A087WR50 | Fn1 | 35.29 | 35.14 | LOG2 scale (~2^35 ≈ 34 billion) |
| A0A087WSN6 | Fn1 | 27.32 | 27.54 | LOG2 scale (~2^27 ≈ 134 million) |
| A0A0R4J039 | Hrg | 27.60 | 28.72 | LOG2 scale |
| A0A0R4J0X5 | Serpina1c | 33.62 | 34.60 | LOG2 scale |

## PHASE 4: Data Scale Analysis

### Merged Database Statistics (Angelidis_2019)

#### Raw Abundance Values:
```
Young Samples:
  Mean:    29.28
  Median:  28.52
  Std:     3.13
  Min:     24.50
  Max:     37.72

Old Samples:
  Mean:    29.48
  Median:  28.86
  Std:     3.14
  Min:     24.43
  Max:     37.76
```

### Scale Determination

#### Question 1: Are values in LINEAR or LOG2 range?

**If LINEAR:** Values range from 24,500 - 37,720,000 (unrealistic for protein intensities)
**If LOG2:** Values represent log2(intensity), plausible range for mass spec

**Visual Test:**
- 2^24.5 ≈ 23 million (reasonable lower bound for LC-MS)
- 2^37.7 ≈ 217 billion (upper bound for high-abundance proteins)
- Range span: ~9,000x dynamic range (typical for proteomics)

**Conclusion:** Values are in **LOG2 SCALE**

#### Question 2: Is log2 already applied or is this raw linear?

**MaxQuant Output Analysis:**
- MaxQuant native output: LINEAR intensities (millions to billions range)
- These were transformed to LOG2 before inclusion in supplementary data
- Evidence: Median 28.52 = log2(~369 million intensity) ✓ reasonable

**Processing Verification:**
- No log2 transformation in parse_angelidis.py ✓
- Raw Excel values ARE ALREADY IN LOG2 ✓
- Conclusion: **Data in database is LOG2 (from Excel), not LINEAR**

---

## PHASE 5: Final Answer and Recommendation

### Question Answers:

#### Q1: What scale does MaxQuant LFQ output?
**Answer:** MaxQuant LFQ outputs **LINEAR intensity values** (tens of millions to billions)

#### Q2: Was log2 transformation applied during processing?
**Answer:** **NO** - Processing scripts pass values directly without transformation
```python
# From parse_angelidis.py line 117
'Abundance': row[col],  # No log2() applied
```

#### Q3: What scale is in the merged database?
**Answer:** **LOG2 SCALE** 
- Source Excel file already contains log2-transformed intensities
- Mean ~29 = log2(~500 million intensity units) ✓ realistic
- No additional transformation in processing

#### Q4: Should we apply log2(x+1) for batch correction?
**Answer:** **NO** - Do NOT apply log2(x+1) because:

1. **Data is already log2 transformed** (median 28.52)
2. **Batch correction algorithms expect:**
   - ComBat-seq: COUNT data (need to reverse log2 first!)
   - ComBat: Microarray-style data (already log2 is correct)
3. **Double-logging would distort data** (log2(28.52) ≈ 4.8, wrong!)

---

## Recommendations for Batch Correction

### Strategy 1: Use Log2 Data Directly (Recommended)
```python
# Current state: Angelidis_2019 values are log2(LFQ intensity)
# For ComBat or similar batch correction:
# Use directly without further transformation
# Risk: Assumes all studies are log2-transformed

abundance = angelidis_data  # Already log2
corrected = combat(abundance, batch_indicator)
```

### Strategy 2: Reverse to Linear, Apply Unified Transformation
```python
# Convert back to linear
abundance_linear = 2 ** angelidis_data

# Apply unified log2(x+1) across all studies
abundance_log = np.log2(abundance_linear + 1)

# Apply batch correction
corrected = combat(abundance_log, batch_indicator)
```

### Strategy 3: Work with Z-scores (Current Implementation)
```python
# Current database already has z-scores
# Batch correction on z-scores is suboptimal
# Better: work at abundance level before z-scoring
```

## Technical Summary

| Parameter | Value | Confidence |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| **Raw Output Scale** | LINEAR (MaxQuant native) | HIGH |
| **Excel File Scale** | LOG2 | HIGH |
| **Processing Transformation** | NONE | HIGH |
| **Database Scale** | LOG2 | HIGH |
| **Apply log2(x+1) for batch correction** | NO | HIGH |
| **Reason** | Already log2; double-logging corrupts data | HIGH |

## Batch Correction Framework Decision

### For Angelidis_2019:

**Current Status:** LOG2 scale in database

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Use abundance values directly (already log2)
2. Do NOT apply additional log2(x+1)
3. Apply ComBat-SVA or ComBat-Seq depending on:
   - If treating as continuous: Use log2 values directly
   - If treating as counts: REVERSE log2 first → apply log2(count+1) → batch correct

**For Multi-Study Batch Correction:**
1. Verify all studies use same scale (recommend all log2)
2. If mixed scales: Standardize to log2(x+1) across all
3. Apply batch correction at ABUNDANCE level (not z-scores)
4. Recalculate z-scores AFTER batch correction
