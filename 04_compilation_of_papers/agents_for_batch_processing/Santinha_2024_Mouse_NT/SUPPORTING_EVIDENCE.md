## EVIDENCE 1: Back-Calculation Formula Analysis

### Mathematical Proof of Log2 Scale

From the TMT adapter script (`tmt_adapter_santinha2024.py`, lines 48-65):

```python
def back_calculate_abundances(df):
    """
    Back-calculate Young and Old abundances from logFC and AveExpr.
    
    Given:
        logFC = log2(Old) - log2(Young)        # [Equation 1]
        AveExpr = (log2(Young) + log2(Old)) / 2  # [Equation 2]
    
    Solve:
        log2(Old) = AveExpr + (logFC / 2)      # [Derived: Add Eq1 to Eq2]
        log2(Young) = AveExpr - (logFC / 2)    # [Derived: Subtract Eq1 from Eq2]
    
    Returns log2-transformed abundances (suitable for z-score normalization).
    """
    df = df.copy()
    df['Abundance_Young'] = df['AveExpr'] - (df['logFC'] / 2)
    df['Abundance_Old'] = df['AveExpr'] + (df['logFC'] / 2)
    return df
```

**Key Point:** The method assumes input (logFC, AveExpr) is already in log2 space.

### Algebraic Verification

Starting with standard differential expression equations:

```
logFC = log2(Mean_Old) - log2(Mean_Young)
AveExpr = (log2(Mean_Young) + log2(Mean_Old)) / 2

Solving for individual expressions:
Let Y = log2(Mean_Young), O = log2(Mean_Old)

From Equation 1: O - Y = logFC        → O = Y + logFC
From Equation 2: (Y + O) / 2 = AveExpr → Y + O = 2*AveExpr

Substitute O = Y + logFC into Y + O = 2*AveExpr:
Y + (Y + logFC) = 2*AveExpr
2Y = 2*AveExpr - logFC
Y = AveExpr - (logFC / 2)  ✓

Similarly:
O = AveExpr + (logFC / 2)  ✓
```

**Conclusion:** Derived abundances are in log2 space by mathematical necessity.

## EVIDENCE 2: TMT Methodology from Paper

### From Santinha et al. Methods Section (Page 2-3)

> "Sample Preparation for MS Analysis  
> Tissue lysates (50 μg) were reduced and then alkylated. Proteins were precipitated, centrifuged and the pellet was washed twice... Protein digestion was started by adding LysC... The reconstituted peptides were used for TMT labeling..."

> "The proteome of left ventricular heart tissue from 20-month-old mice (old) was compared to the proteome of young mice (3 months). Both age groups were analyzed by TMT-based quantitative mass spectrometry. Five male C57BL/6 mice were used for each age group."

### TMT-10plex Processing

Key facts about TMT isobaric labeling:
- Reporter ions m/z 126-131 generate intensities from MS2 scans
- Intensities quantified per sample
- Standard normalization includes log2 transformation
- Output format in papers: typically logFC (log2 fold-change) and AveExpr (average log2 intensity)

### Supplementary Data Format (mmc2.xlsx)

From the paper supplementary description:
- Column: "gene.name" → Gene symbols
- Column: "ID" → UniProt protein IDs
- Column: "logFC" → Log2 fold-change (Old vs Young)
- Column: "AveExpr" → Average expression in log2 scale
- Column: "adj.p.val" → Adjusted p-value
- Column: "description" → Protein names

**This is standard limma/edgeR differential expression output format in R.**

## EVIDENCE 3: Distribution Statistics Analysis

### Abundance Distribution Characteristics

**Mouse_NT Young (3 months):**
```
Count: 191 ECM proteins
Mean: 15.8824
Median: 15.9778
Std Dev: 1.2189
Min: 12.4807
Max: 19.4320
Skewness: -0.073
Kurtosis: (implied from metadata)
Q1: 15.0950
Q3: 16.6814
IQR: 1.5864
```

**Mouse_NT Old (20 months):**
```
Count: 191 ECM proteins
Mean: 16.0277
Median: 16.1511
Std Dev: 1.2476
Min: 12.7382
Max: 19.8701
Skewness: -0.117
Q1: 15.2175
Q3: 16.8701
IQR: 1.6526
```

### Why This Range Confirms LOG2

**If abundance were LINEAR intensity:**
- Median 15.98 would represent ~16 intensity units
- Typical MS reporter intensities: 1,000-100,000 counts
- Median value of 16 would be absurdly low
- No proteomics dataset has median intensity of 16 units

**If abundance is LOG2 intensity:**
- Median 15.98 represents 2^15.98 ≈ 65,000 intensity units
- Typical TMT reporter intensities: 50,000-100,000 counts
- Median of 65,000 is biologically reasonable
- Standard range for high-quality TMT data ✓

### Example Calculation: Lactadherin (MFGE8)

From the dataset:
- Protein_ID: P21956
- Gene_Symbol: Mfge8
- Abundance_Young: 15.950933
- Abundance_Old: 16.588212

**If linear:** Would mean Young = 15.95 intensity, Old = 16.59 intensity
- Too low for any MS instrument

**If log2:** 
- Young linear: 2^15.950933 ≈ 63,930 counts
- Old linear: 2^16.588212 ≈ 93,490 counts
- Age-related increase: ~46% (biologically sensible)
- Within typical TMT range ✓

## EVIDENCE 4: Cross-Dataset Consistency Check

### All Three Santinha Datasets Use Same Processing

| Metric | Mouse_NT | Mouse_DT | Human |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| Method | TMT-10plex | TMT-10plex | TMT-10plex |
| Processing Script | tmt_adapter_santinha2024.py | Same | Same |
| Back-Calc Formula | AveExpr ± logFC/2 | Same | Same |
| Species Reference | mouse_matrisome_v2.csv | Same | human_matrisome_v2.csv |
| Young Mean | 15.8824 | 16.6542 | 14.7995 |
| Old Mean | 16.0277 | 16.8195 | 15.1171 |
| Scale | LOG2 | LOG2 | LOG2 |

### Biological Interpretation of Offsets

**Mouse_DT vs Mouse_NT offset: +0.765 log2 units**
- Linear multiplier: 2^0.765 ≈ 1.70x
- Reason: Decellularized tissue enriched for structural ECM proteins
- Paper confirms: "The enrichment of ECM and ECM-associated proteins in DT was evidenced by the higher ratio of collagen per mg of total protein"
- Metabolic interpretation: DT has 70% higher ECM protein abundance than NT

**Human vs Mouse_NT offset: -1.081 log2 units**
- Linear multiplier: 2^(-1.081) ≈ 0.47x
- Reason: Different species, different ECM composition
- Biological rationale: Human cardiac tissue has different proteomic signature than mouse
- Consistent with cross-species differences in ECM proteins

**Conclusion:** Offset pattern makes sense ONLY if using log2 scale.

## EVIDENCE 5: Z-Score Metadata Validation

    }
  }
}
```

### Interpretation of Key Fields

**`log2_transformed: false`**
- Means: "Did NOT apply log2 transformation to input abundances"
- Reason: Skewness (-0.073, -0.117) < 1.0, indicating already log-transformed data
- Skewness interpretation:
  - Linear data: typically skew 1-3+ in proteomics
  - Log2-transformed data: typically skew ±0.5 or less
  - Our data skew: -0.073 to -0.117 (very close to normal) → confirms log2 already applied

**`z_mean_young: 0.0, z_std_young: 1.0`**
- Validation: Z-scores properly standardized
- Formula applied: z = (x - μ) / σ
  - z_young = (15.8824 - 15.8824) / 1.2189 = 0.0 ✓
  - σ_z = 1.2189 / 1.2189 = 1.0 ✓

**`validation_passed: true`**
- Confirms all statistical checks passed
- No anomalies detected in standardization

## EVIDENCE 6: Paper's Explicit Statements

### From Results Section - Quantification Details

Page 4: "Using this approach, we quantified a total of approximately 5000 protein groups across all ages using at least two unique proteotypic peptides..."

Page 4: "Although principal component analysis (PCA) showed no obvious separation between old and young proteomes (Fig. 1B), 5.6% of proteins had different abundance between young and old LVs (Fig. 1C)."

### From Methods - Statistical Analysis (Page 3)

"For the heart proteome analyses, the left ventricular heart tissue of young (n = 5) and aged (n = 5) C57BL/6 mice was used for quantitative mass spectrometry. The proteins were considered significantly altered with an adjusted p value <0.25 and absolute log2 fold change >0.58."

**Key phrase: "absolute log2 fold change"** - explicitly states fold-changes are in log2 space

## EVIDENCE 7: Skewness Analysis - Log-Transformed Data Signature

### Skewness Values Confirm Log2 Transform

| Group | Skewness | Interpretation |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| Young | -0.073 | Symmetric (very slight left skew) |
| Old | -0.117 | Symmetric (very slight left skew) |
| Threshold for untransformed data | ±1.0 | Moderate skew expected |
| Threshold for log-transformed data | ±0.5 | Minimal skew expected |
| **Our data** | **-0.073 to -0.117** | **Consistent with log2-transformed** ✓ |

### Explanation

Linear abundance distributions in proteomics:
- Right-skewed (skewness +1 to +3)
- Heavy right tail (many high outliers)
- Mean > Median

Log2-transformed distributions:
- Approximately symmetric (skewness ±0.5 or less)
- Normal-like distribution
- Mean ≈ Median

Our data characteristics:
- Young: Mean 15.8824, Median 15.9778 (mean < median = left skew) → log2-like
- Old: Mean 16.0277, Median 16.1511 (mean < median = left skew) → log2-like
- Skewness values (-0.073, -0.117) consistent with log2-transformed proteomics

## EVIDENCE 8: Metadata Comparison Across All Santinha Datasets

### Skewness Consistency

**Mouse_NT:**
- Young skewness: -0.073
- Old skewness: -0.117

**Mouse_DT:**
- Young skewness: +0.011
- Old skewness: -0.059

**Human:**
- Young skewness: +0.033
- Old skewness: +0.033

All three datasets show skewness in range ±0.15 or less, consistent with log2-transformed data.
(If linear, would expect skewness 1-3+)
