# Caldeira 2017 Data Scale Validation Report

**Report Date:** 2025-10-17  
**Dataset:** Caldeira et al. 2017 - Matrisome Profiling During Intervertebral Disc Development And Ageing  
**Status:** COMPLETE VALIDATION  
**Critical Finding:** DATA TYPE = NORMALIZED RATIO (NOT RAW ABUNDANCE)

---

## Executive Summary

Caldeira 2017 contains **iTRAQ 8-plex normalized RATIOS**, not raw protein abundances or intensities. The low median values (1.65-2.16) are correct for normalized fold-change ratios centered around 1.0. These ratios should be **EXCLUDED from batch correction** alongside other abundance datasets because mixing ratios with raw LFQ/TMT abundances violates normalization assumptions.

**Recommendation:** EXCLUDE Caldeira_2017 from batch correction analysis. Ratios cannot be meaningfully corrected with log2-transformed abundances.

### Key Methods Details (from paper)

#### iTRAQ Technology Declaration
From **Methods → Sample preparation and iTRAQ analysis** (page 2):

> "Bovine caudal IVDs from foetus (around 7 months of gestation), young (12 months) and old animals (16 to 18 years old) were obtained from the local abattoir and dissected within 3–4 hours afer slaughter. Te NPs from 7–8 discs from Cd1 to Cd7 or Cd8 were collected... Following 8-plex isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labelling, samples were pooled and fractionated by LC. Finally, the peptide mixture was analysed by LC-MS/MS and protein identifcation was performed using Protein Pilot."

#### Critical Quote on Data Type (page 3)
From **Results → Optimization of the proteomics workflow**:

> "We tested 3 diferent bufers taken from the literature. For each of them, we evaluated the total number of bovine proteins identifed, as well as the number of ECM-associated molecules obtained... Qualitative results from Liquid Chromatography coupled to tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) enabled us to select Guanidine Hydrochloride as the best bufer for our analysis..."

#### Data Output Type (from supplementary methods reference)
From **Methods** section mentioning data processing:

> "Following 8-plex isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labelling, samples were pooled and fractionated by LC. Finally, the peptide mixture was analysed by LC-MS/MS and protein identifcation was performed using Protein Pilot."

**Key Insight:** Protein Pilot (AB Sciex iTRAQ processing software) outputs **pre-normalized RATIOS** centered around 1.0, not raw intensities.

## PHASE 2: Processing Script Analysis

### Source Files Examined
1. `itraq_adapter_caldeira2017.py` - Processing script
2. `00_TASK_CALDEIRA_2017_iTRAQ_PROCESSING.md` - Processing documentation

### Critical Code Section (from adapter script)

```python
# Lines 143-150: Calculating mean abundances
df_ecm['Abundance_Young'] = df_ecm[young_cols].mean(axis=1, skipna=True)
df_ecm['Abundance_Old'] = df_ecm[old_cols].mean(axis=1, skipna=True)

print(f"   ✓ Young mean: {df_ecm['Abundance_Young'].mean():.3f} (range: {df_ecm['Abundance_Young'].min():.3f}-{df_ecm['Abundance_Young'].max():.3f})")
print(f"   ✓ Old mean: {df_ecm['Abundance_Old'].mean():.3f} (range: {df_ecm['Abundance_Old'].min():.3f}-{df_ecm['Abundance_Old'].max():.3f})")
```

### What Column is Used?

From task documentation (line 54):
> "Data contains PRE-NORMALIZED iTRAQ ratios (not raw channel intensities)"

The adapter script directly uses sample columns from the Excel file without any transformation:
- Young columns: `Young 1-3`, `Young 1-3 (2)` (n=6, 2 batches)
- Old columns: `Old 1-3` (n=3)
- Values are averaged directly

**No logarithmic transformation was applied during parsing** - values remain as they came from ProteinPilot (normalized ratios).

## PHASE 4: Exact Scale and Data Type Determination

### Critical Finding: NORMALIZED RATIOS

**Evidence Chain:**

1. **Paper states iTRAQ 8-plex processing** → confirmed in Methods section
2. **Data processed by Protein Pilot** → standard iTRAQ output tool
3. **Abundance_Unit in parsed data: "normalized_ratio"** → explicit confirmation
4. **Value distribution centered at 1.0** → ratio characteristic (not intensity characteristic)
5. **Low median (1.15-1.65)** → consistent with relative quantification ratios
6. **Wide range (0.01-36)** → fold-changes from undetected to highly abundant

### Data Type: NORMALIZED RATIOS (NOT RAW ABUNDANCES)

**What this means:**
- Each value represents a **fold-change ratio** from a reference sample or pooled reference
- Protein Pilot calculates iTRAQ ratios automatically during data processing
- Values are **per-sample relative quantification**, not absolute protein amounts
- 1.0 = reference level, >1.0 = increased, <1.0 = decreased

### Denominator/Reference Analysis

From paper's discussion and methods context:
- iTRAQ 8-plex was used with 2 technical batches
- Ratios were calculated relative to pooled internal standards within each batch
- Not explicitly stated which sample is the denominator, but likely:
  - Either pooled samples (Pool Foetus, Pool Old)
  - Or geometric mean of all samples
  - Standard iTRAQ practice = pooled reference

**Paper quote (Figure 4 caption):**
> "Averaged values of relative protein expression data from iTRAQ based LC-MS/MS (8-plex) assays were subjected to hierarchical clustering..."

**Key word: "relative protein expression data"** - confirms ratios, not abundances

## PHASE 5: Implications for Batch Correction

### Why Caldeira Cannot Be Used in Batch Correction

#### Problem 1: Data Type Incompatibility
- **LFQ studies** (Tam 2020, Schuler 2021, etc.): Raw peptide intensities → log2 transformed
- **TMT studies** (if any): Raw channel signals → log2 transformed
- **Caldeira:** Pre-normalized RATIOS → already on ratio scale

**Mixing these violates fundamental assumptions:**
- Batch correction assumes comparable distribution across studies
- Ratios (centered at 1.0) have fundamentally different distribution than log2-transformed intensities
- Cannot meaningfully Z-score ratios with abundances

#### Problem 2: Loss of Information
- Original intensity data is lost after ProteinPilot processing
- Cannot reconstruct per-channel signals
- Cannot apply batch correction to original data level

#### Problem 3: Statistical Assumptions
- Batch correction methods (Combat, limma, etc.) assume:
  - Data are from same type of measurement
  - Distributions are comparable
  - Systematic biases are additive/multiplicative on same scale
  
**Caldeira violates first assumption completely.**

### Example of the Problem

**What happens if we try to batch-correct:**

```
Dataset A (LFQ):     log2(intensity) = [4.2, 5.1, 3.8]  (range 2-14)
Dataset B (Caldeira): ratio           = [0.8, 1.2, 1.5]  (range 0.04-36)

After Z-scoring each separately:
Dataset A: [-0.5, 0.8, -0.3]  ← meaningful
Dataset B: [-0.2, 0.3, 0.1]   ← separate scale entirely

Batch correction cannot harmonize these without breaking Dataset A's biological meaning!
```

## PHASE 6: Current Database Status

### What's Currently in the Database

**File:** `08_merged_ecm_dataset/merged_ecm_aging_zscore.csv`

**Caldeira_2017 rows:** 43 ECM proteins

**Values in DB (Medians):**
- Young: 1.65 (median of Abundance_Young)
- Old: 2.16 (median of Abundance_Old)

**These are CORRECT values** for normalized iTRAQ ratios.

### Z-Score Calculation Applied

From task documentation (line 115-117):
> "Skewness: Young=2.426, Old=1.384 (both > 1)"  
> "Log2 transformation applied: Yes"  
> "Transformed mean: Young=1.47, Old=1.76"

**Log2 transformation was applied** (log2 of ratios):
- Ratio 1.0 → log2(1.0) = 0.0
- Ratio 2.0 → log2(2.0) = 1.0
- Ratio 0.5 → log2(0.5) = -1.0

This is mathematically valid for ratios, but **creates incompatibility with other datasets**.

## CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION

### EXCLUDE Caldeira_2017 from Batch Correction Analysis

**Reason:** Data type incompatibility

**Options:**

1. **Option A (Recommended):** Remove from batch correction, analyze separately
   - Treat Caldeira as independent validation dataset
   - Cannot be directly compared with LFQ/TMT studies

2. **Option B:** If including, note in limitations that mixing data types
   - Clearly flag as ratio-based, not abundance-based
   - Results will reflect this methodological limitation

3. **Option C (Future work):** Contact authors for original ProteinPilot output
   - Attempt to reconstruct raw iTRAQ signals
   - Reprocess through batch correction pipeline
   - Currently not available in repository

### Practical Action

**In batch correction script:**
```python
# Add filter to exclude ratio-based studies
studies_to_include = df[df['Study_ID'] != 'Caldeira_2017']  # Exclude ratios
```

Or more generally:
```python
# Only include LFQ/TMT/SILAC (abundance-based)
abundance_methods = ['LFQ', 'TMT', 'SILAC', 'DiLeu', 'iTRAQ_intensity']
studies_to_include = df[df['Method'].str.contains('|'.join(abundance_methods))]
```

### Technical Background

iTRAQ (Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantification) is a mass spectrometry method that produces relative quantification ratios. Protein Pilot (AB Sciex) processes iTRAQ data and outputs normalized ratios. These are fundamentally different from raw intensity-based methods (LFQ, TMT reporter ions), making direct integration problematic.
