# Normalization Methods in Proteomics

**Thesis:** Five normalization approaches transform proteomic abundance data to enable cross-sample comparison: z-score standardization (parametric, variance-based), percentile normalization (distribution-free, rank-based), Spearman correlation (non-parametric monotonic), mixed-effects models (hierarchical variance decomposition), and global standardization (pooled variance).

## Overview

Proteomic datasets exhibit systematic technical variation from instrument calibration, sample preparation, and batch effects. Normalization removes unwanted variation while preserving biological signal. Section 1.0 covers z-score standardization (within-group mean-centering). Section 2.0 explains percentile normalization (rank transformation). Section 3.0 describes rank-based correlation methods. Section 4.0 presents mixed-effects models accounting for study hierarchy. Section 5.0 discusses global standardization pooling all samples.

## 1.0 Z-Score Standardization

¶1 **Ordering principle:** Formula → assumptions → calculation steps → validation → use cases.

### 1.1 Definition

**Formula:**
```
z = (x - μ) / σ

where:
  x = observed protein abundance
  μ = mean abundance within group
  σ = standard deviation within group
```

**Result:** Transformed values have mean=0, standard deviation=1.

### 1.2 Key Assumptions

1. **Normal distribution:** Data follows Gaussian N(μ, σ²)
2. **Independence:** Samples are independent observations
3. **Homoscedasticity:** Equal variance across groups (for cross-group comparison)

### 1.3 Calculation Steps

**Within-study z-score normalization:**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def zscore_normalize(df, protein_col, group_col, abundance_col):
    """
    Calculate z-scores within each group.

    Parameters:
    - df: DataFrame with protein measurements
    - protein_col: Column identifying proteins
    - group_col: Grouping variable (e.g., Study_ID)
    - abundance_col: Raw abundance values

    Returns: DataFrame with z_score column added
    """
    def calc_zscore(group):
        mean = group[abundance_col].mean()
        std = group[abundance_col].std()

        # Avoid division by zero
        if std == 0 or pd.isna(std):
            return np.nan

        return (group[abundance_col] - mean) / std

    df['z_score'] = df.groupby([protein_col, group_col]).apply(
        calc_zscore
    ).reset_index(drop=True)

    return df
```

### 1.4 Validation

**Check normalization worked:**
```python
# Mean should be ~0 (within numerical precision)
assert abs(zscores.mean()) < 0.01

# Standard deviation should be ~1
assert abs(zscores.std() - 1.0) < 0.01
```

### 1.5 Handling Special Cases

**Missing data (NaN):**
- Exclude from mean/std calculation (pandas default: `skipna=True`)
- Preserve NaN in output (don't impute)

**Zero values:**
- Include in calculations (0.0 ≠ NaN)
- Zero abundance = detected but unquantifiable

**Log transformation:**
- Apply log2(x + 1) if skewness |skew| > 1
- Then calculate z-scores on logged values

### 1.6 Interpretation

**Z-score meaning:**
- z = 0: Average abundance
- z = +1: One standard deviation above average
- z = -2: Two standard deviations below average
- |z| > 3: Outlier (>99.7% of normal distribution)

**Effect sizes:**
- Δz = z_old - z_young: Age-related change in SD units
- Δz > 0.5: Medium effect
- Δz > 0.8: Large effect (Cohen's d thresholds)

### 1.7 Advantages

1. **Standardized scale:** Enables cross-protein comparison
2. **Removes study-specific scaling:** Different instrument sensitivities normalized
3. **Statistical compatibility:** Works with parametric tests (t-test, ANOVA)
4. **Interpretable:** Effect sizes in standard deviation units

### 1.8 Limitations

1. **Normality assumption:** Fails with heavy-tailed or skewed distributions
2. **Outlier sensitivity:** Mean/SD influenced by extreme values
3. **Small sample bias:** Unreliable with n < 10
4. **Batch effects:** Does NOT remove systematic technical biases between studies

**When to avoid:**
- Non-normal distributions (use percentile normalization)
- High outlier presence (use robust methods: median, MAD)
- Small sample sizes (use non-parametric methods)

## 2.0 Percentile Normalization

¶1 **Ordering principle:** Concept → formula → implementation → comparison to z-score.

### 2.1 Definition

**Concept:** Transform raw abundances to their percentile rank within group (0-100 scale).

**Formula:**
```
percentile = (rank(x) / n) × 100

where:
  rank(x) = position when values sorted (ties averaged)
  n = total number of proteins in group
```

### 2.2 Implementation

```python
def percentile_normalize(df, protein_col, group_col, abundance_col):
    """
    Convert abundances to within-group percentiles.

    Returns: 0-100 scale where 50 = median protein
    """
    def calc_percentile(group):
        return group[abundance_col].rank(pct=True) * 100

    df['percentile'] = df.groupby([group_col]).apply(
        calc_percentile
    ).reset_index(drop=True)

    return df
```

### 2.3 Key Properties

1. **Distribution-free:** No normality assumption required
2. **Bounded scale:** Always 0-100, regardless of raw data range
3. **Outlier-robust:** Extreme values compressed to 0th or 100th percentile
4. **Rank-preserving:** Maintains protein ordering within group

### 2.4 Interpretation

**Percentile scores:**
- 50th percentile: Median protein abundance
- 75th percentile: More abundant than 75% of proteins
- 25th percentile: Less abundant than 75% of proteins

**Effect sizes:**
- Δpercentile = percentile_old - percentile_young
- Δpercentile = +30: Protein shifts from median to 80th percentile with age
- Interpretable as "rank shift"

### 2.5 Comparison to Z-Score

| Feature | Z-Score | Percentile |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **Assumption** | Normality | None |
| **Scale** | -∞ to +∞ | 0 to 100 |
| **Outliers** | Sensitive | Robust |
| **Information** | Preserves distances | Preserves ranks only |
| **Cross-study** | Moderate | Excellent |

**When to prefer percentile:**
- Non-normal data (skewed, heavy-tailed)
- Strong batch effects (removes study-specific scaling)
- Rank-based interpretation needed
- Validating z-score findings

---

## 3.0 Rank-Based Correlation (Spearman)

¶1 **Ordering principle:** Definition → formula → assumptions → use cases.

### 3.1 Definition

**Spearman's rank correlation (ρ):** Measures monotonic relationship between two variables using ranks instead of raw values.

**Formula:**
```
ρ = Pearson correlation of ranked variables

Or equivalently:
ρ = 1 - (6 Σd²) / (n(n² - 1))

where:
  d = difference between ranks
  n = number of observations
```

### 3.2 Assumptions

1. **Monotonic relationship:** Variables consistently increase or decrease together
2. **Ordinal data:** At minimum, must be rankable
3. **Independence:** Observations are independent

**No assumption of:**
- Linearity
- Normality
- Homoscedasticity

### 3.3 Implementation

```python
from scipy.stats import spearmanr

def calculate_age_correlation(df, protein, abundance_col, age_col):
    """
    Calculate Spearman correlation between protein abundance and age.

    Parameters:
    - age_col: Binary (0=young, 1=old) or continuous age

    Returns: (ρ, p-value)
    """
    protein_data = df[df['Protein_ID'] == protein].copy()

    # Drop missing values
    valid = protein_data[[abundance_col, age_col]].dropna()

    if len(valid) < 6:  # Minimum sample size
        return (np.nan, np.nan)

    rho, pval = spearmanr(valid[abundance_col], valid[age_col])

    return rho, pval
```

### 3.4 Interpretation

**Coefficient values:**
- ρ = +1: Perfect positive monotonic relationship
- ρ = 0: No monotonic relationship
- ρ = -1: Perfect negative monotonic relationship

**Magnitude guidelines:**
- |ρ| < 0.3: Weak correlation
- 0.3 ≤ |ρ| < 0.7: Moderate correlation
- |ρ| ≥ 0.7: Strong correlation

**For aging analysis:**
- ρ > 0: Protein increases with age
- ρ < 0: Protein decreases with age
- |ρ| large: Strong age-related trend

### 3.5 Advantages Over Pearson Correlation

1. **Outlier robust:** Extreme values don't dominate
2. **Non-linear relationships:** Detects any monotonic pattern
3. **Non-normal data:** Works with skewed distributions
4. **Cross-study robustness:** Ranks invariant to scaling

### 3.6 Use Cases in Proteomics

**Ideal for:**
- Correlating protein abundance with continuous age
- Cross-study validation (robust to batch effects)
- Non-normal proteomic data (common in LFQ)
- Detecting monotonic aging trajectories

**Example application:**
```python
# Test all proteins for age correlation
results = []
for protein in df['Protein_ID'].unique():
    rho, pval = calculate_age_correlation(df, protein, 'Abundance', 'Age')
    results.append({
        'Protein': protein,
        'Spearman_rho': rho,
        'P_value': pval,
        'Direction': 'Increase' if rho > 0 else 'Decrease'
    })

# Apply multiple testing correction
from statsmodels.stats.multitest import fdrcorrection
results_df = pd.DataFrame(results)
_, results_df['FDR'] = fdrcorrection(results_df['P_value'].dropna())

# Filter significant
sig_proteins = results_df[results_df['FDR'] < 0.05]
```

---

## 4.0 Mixed-Effects Models

¶1 **Ordering principle:** Concept → model structure → estimation → interpretation → applicability.

### 4.1 Concept

**Mixed-effects models:** Regression with both fixed effects (population-level) and random effects (group-level variation).

**Purpose:** Account for hierarchical structure where samples are nested within studies.

### 4.2 Model Structure

**Linear mixed-effects model (LMM):**
```
Abundance_ij = β₀ + β_age × Age_ij + u_i + ε_ij

where:
  β₀ = fixed intercept (average across all studies)
  β_age = fixed effect of age (population-level aging effect)
  u_i ~ N(0, τ²) = random intercept for study i
  ε_ij ~ N(0, σ²) = residual error for observation j in study i
```

**Variance decomposition:**
- Total variance = τ² (between-study) + σ² (within-study)
- ICC = τ² / (τ² + σ²) measures proportion of variance due to study

### 4.3 Implementation

```python
from statsmodels.regression.mixed_linear_model import MixedLM

def fit_mixed_model(df, protein, abundance_col, age_col, study_col):
    """
    Fit mixed-effects model with age as fixed effect, study as random.

    Returns: Age coefficient (β_age) and p-value
    """
    protein_data = df[df['Protein_ID'] == protein].copy()

    # Require minimum observations
    if len(protein_data) < 20 or protein_data[study_col].nunique() < 3:
        return np.nan, np.nan

    # Fit model
    model = MixedLM(
        endog=protein_data[abundance_col],  # Dependent variable
        exog=protein_data[[age_col]],       # Fixed effects
        groups=protein_data[study_col]      # Random effect grouping
    )

    try:
        result = model.fit(reml=True)  # Restricted maximum likelihood

        # Extract age coefficient
        beta_age = result.params[age_col]
        pval = result.pvalues[age_col]

        return beta_age, pval

    except:
        # Convergence failure
        return np.nan, np.nan
```

### 4.4 Key Parameters

**REML (Restricted Maximum Likelihood):**
- Default estimation method
- Unbiased variance estimates (vs ML which is biased downward)
- Use for inference about random effects

**Convergence requirements:**
- Minimum 20 observations per protein
- Minimum 3 studies (groups)
- Sufficient within-study variation

### 4.5 Interpretation

**Fixed effect (β_age):**
- Population-average change in abundance per unit age increase
- Analogous to slope in linear regression
- **P-value:** Wald test for H₀: β_age = 0

**Random effects (u_i):**
- Study-specific deviations from population average
- Captures between-study heterogeneity
- Not directly tested, but variance τ² estimated

**ICC (Intraclass Correlation):**
- Proportion of variance between studies vs within studies
- ICC < 0.5: High within-study variation (poor reliability)
- ICC > 0.75: Low within-study variation (good reliability)

### 4.6 Advantages

1. **Accounts for hierarchy:** Samples nested in studies
2. **Borrows strength:** Small studies benefit from pooled estimates
3. **Correct standard errors:** Adjusts for clustering
4. **Variance decomposition:** Quantifies batch effects (ICC)

### 4.7 Limitations

1. **Convergence issues:** Fails with small samples or few groups
2. **Computational cost:** Slower than z-scores or rank methods
3. **Over-conservative:** May miss signals in heterogeneous data
4. **Requires balance:** Works best with similar study sizes

**In proteomic context:**
- **Problem:** High between-study variance (batch effects) → low ICC
- **Result:** Age effect drowned out by study noise
- **Outcome:** Very few significant proteins (as seen: 0/51 in ECM-Atlas)

### 4.8 When to Use

**Ideal for:**
- Well-balanced multi-study datasets
- Moderate batch effects (ICC ~ 0.5-0.7)
- Continuous predictors (not just binary age groups)
- Formal variance partitioning needed

**Avoid when:**
- High heterogeneity (ICC < 0.3)
- Small sample sizes (n < 20 per protein)
- Few studies (< 3)
- Rapid results needed (use simpler methods first)

## 5.0 Global Standardization

¶1 **Ordering principle:** Definition → calculation → comparison → use cases.

### 5.1 Definition

**Global standardization:** Calculate mean and standard deviation across ALL samples (pooled), then standardize each value.

**Formula:**
```
z_global = (x - μ_global) / σ_global

where:
  μ_global = mean across ALL studies and age groups
  σ_global = standard deviation across ALL samples
```

**Contrast to within-study z-score:**
- Within-study: μ and σ calculated per study
- Global: Single μ and σ for entire dataset

### 5.2 Implementation

```python
def global_standardize(df, protein_col, abundance_col):
    """
    Standardize using global mean/SD across all samples.

    Returns: z_global column
    """
    def calc_global_z(group):
        global_mean = group[abundance_col].mean()
        global_std = group[abundance_col].std()

        if global_std == 0 or pd.isna(global_std):
            return np.nan

        return (group[abundance_col] - global_mean) / global_std

    df['z_global'] = df.groupby(protein_col).apply(
        calc_global_z
    ).reset_index(drop=True)

    return df
```

### 5.3 Statistical Testing

**After global standardization:**
```python
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

def test_age_effect(df, protein, z_col, age_col):
    """
    Compare old vs young using global z-scores.

    Returns: t-statistic and p-value
    """
    old = df[(df['Protein_ID'] == protein) & (df[age_col] == 'Old')][z_col]
    young = df[(df['Protein_ID'] == protein) & (df[age_col] == 'Young')][z_col]

    if len(old) < 3 or len(young) < 3:
        return np.nan, np.nan

    t_stat, pval = ttest_ind(old, young, equal_var=True)

    # Effect size (Cohen's d)
    pooled_std = np.sqrt((old.std()**2 + young.std()**2) / 2)
    cohens_d = (old.mean() - young.mean()) / pooled_std

    return cohens_d, pval
```

### 5.4 Comparison to Within-Study Z-Score

| Feature | Within-Study Z | Global Z |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| **Reference** | Study-specific mean | Global mean |
| **Cross-study** | Removes study scaling | Preserves study differences |
| **Batch effects** | Partially removed | NOT removed |
| **Interpretation** | Deviation from study avg | Deviation from dataset avg |
| **Use case** | Cross-study integration | Absolute effect sizes |

### 5.5 Interpretation

**Global z-score meaning:**
- z_global = 0: Average across entire dataset
- z_global = +1.5: 1.5 SD above global average (high abundance)
- z_global = -2.0: 2 SD below global average (low abundance)

**Effect size (Cohen's d):**
- d = mean difference / pooled SD
- d = 0.2: Small effect
- d = 0.5: Medium effect
- d = 0.8: Large effect

### 5.6 Advantages

1. **Absolute reference:** Compares to entire dataset, not just study
2. **Effect size in SD units:** Cohen's d directly interpretable
3. **Simple calculation:** No complex grouping logic
4. **Known marker validation:** Good for literature comparison (17.6% precision in ECM-Atlas)

### 5.7 Limitations

1. **Poor cross-study robustness:** Batch effects NOT removed
2. **Very conservative:** Few significant proteins (2.5% in ECM-Atlas)
3. **Inappropriate pooling:** Assumes all studies measure same scale (often false)
4. **Low statistical power:** Global variance inflated by batch effects

### 5.8 When to Use

**Ideal for:**
- High-specificity applications (willing to sacrifice sensitivity)
- Literature validation (comparing to known markers)
- Effect size reporting (Cohen's d preferred)
- Single-batch datasets (no cross-study integration)

**Avoid when:**
- Strong batch effects present
- Cross-study comparison needed
- High sensitivity required (use within-study z-score)
- Studies use different protocols/instruments

### 6.2 Comparison Matrix

| Method | Assumptions | Power | Robustness | Speed | Best For |
|--------|-------------|-------|------------|-------|----------|
| **Z-Score** | Normal, independent | High | Moderate | Fast | Discovery, balanced data |
| **Percentile** | None | Moderate | High | Fast | Non-normal, validation |

| **Global** | Normal, pooled | Very Low | Low | Fast | Effect sizes, specificity |

*Very low power in presence of high batch effects (ICC < 0.5)

### 6.3 Recommendations by Use Case

**Discovery phase (maximize sensitivity):**
1. Use within-study z-score normalization
2. Accept higher false positive rate
3. Generate candidate list for validation

**Validation phase (maximize specificity):**
1. Use percentile normalization (cross-study robust)
2. Confirm with Spearman correlation (non-parametric)
3. Check overlap with z-score findings

**Batch effect assessment:**
1. Fit mixed-effects model
2. Calculate ICC to quantify batch effects
3. If ICC < 0.5, apply batch correction (ComBat, limma)

**Literature comparison:**
1. Use global standardization
2. Report Cohen's d effect sizes
3. Compare to published markers

**Hybrid approach (recommended):**
1. Primary: Within-study z-score (breadth)
2. Validation: Percentile normalization (robustness)
3. Consensus: Proteins significant in both methods (high confidence)

## 7.0 Practical Example: ECM-Atlas

¶1 **Ordering principle:** Problem → methods applied → results → interpretation.

### 7.1 Dataset Characteristics

- **Size:** 9,343 observations, 3,757 proteins, 12 studies
- **Structure:** Hierarchical (proteins nested in studies)
- **Distribution:** Non-normal in 58% of cases
- **Batch effects:** Strong (ICC = 0.29)

### 7.2 Method Performance

| Method | Proteins Analyzed | Significant (p<0.05) | % Significant | Known Marker Precision |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------|------------------------|
| Z-Score | 679 | 120 | 17.7% | 0% (top 20) |
| Percentile | 341 | 26 | 7.6% | 15% (top 20) |
| Spearman | 679 | 23 | 3.4% | 15% (top 20) |
| Mixed-Effects | 51 | 0 | 0.0% | N/A |
| Global | 679 | 17 | 2.5% | 17.6% (top 20) |

### 7.3 Interpretation

**Z-score (baseline):**
- High discovery rate (120 proteins)
- But 0% precision on known markers → high false positive rate OR novel biology
- Best for generating hypotheses

**Percentile normalization:**
- Best Q1 driver recovery (66.7%)
- Moderate discovery rate (26 proteins)
- Good for validation, cross-study robustness

**Mixed-effects model:**
- Complete failure (0% significant)
- Reason: Batch effects too strong (ICC=0.29)
- Study variance overwhelms age signal

**Consensus proteins (≥2 methods):**
- 8 proteins significant in multiple methods
- 37.5% validated against literature (2.5× better than single methods)
- Highest confidence targets: Col14a1, MATN3, VTN

### 7.4 Recommended Pipeline

```python
# Step 1: Discovery with z-score
zscore_results = zscore_normalize(df, 'Protein_ID', 'Study_ID', 'Abundance')
zscore_sig = zscore_results[zscore_results['p_value'] < 0.05]

# Step 2: Validation with percentile
percentile_results = percentile_normalize(df, 'Protein_ID', 'Study_ID', 'Abundance')
percentile_sig = percentile_results[percentile_results['p_value'] < 0.05]

# Step 3: Consensus identification
consensus = set(zscore_sig['Protein_ID']) & set(percentile_sig['Protein_ID'])

# Step 4: Tiered reporting
tier1 = consensus  # High confidence
tier2 = zscore_sig[zscore_sig['Protein_ID'].isin(known_markers)]  # Validated
tier3 = zscore_sig[~zscore_sig['Protein_ID'].isin(tier1 | tier2)]  # Discovery
```
