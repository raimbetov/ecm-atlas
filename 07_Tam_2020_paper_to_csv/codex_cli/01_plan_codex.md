# Plan for Tam 2020 Dataset Analysis

- [x] Confirm requirements by reviewing Tam 2020 task brief and cross-referencing schema/annotation guidelines to extract mandatory deliverables and validation rules.
- [x] Inspect raw Excel inputs (`elife-64940-supp1-v3.xlsx`) to verify sheet availability, dimensions, and key column names needed for parsing and metadata joins.
- [x] Validate metadata alignment by sampling `Sample information` entries and ensuring profile identifiers match LFQ intensity columns in `Raw data`.
- [x] Map required transformations to the standardized schema, age binning, annotation workflow, and z-score outputs, calling out dependencies (reference files, existing scripts).
- [x] Summarize risks, open questions, and recommended execution approach that downstream agents can follow for conversion and normalization.
