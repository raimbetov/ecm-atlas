# Universal ECM Aging Markers: Cross-Tissue Analysis

**Thesis:** Analysis of 8,948 proteomic measurements across 17 tissue compartments identifies 405 ECM proteins showing consistent directional changes during aging, with top 10 candidates demonstrating ≥70% cross-tissue concordance and statistical significance (p<0.05).

## Overview

This analysis systematically evaluates 3317 unique ECM proteins across 17 tissue/compartment combinations from 12 proteomic aging studies. Universal aging markers are defined by four criteria: (1) tissue breadth (present in ≥3 tissues), (2) directional consistency (≥70% same direction), (3) effect size (mean |Zscore_Delta|), and (4) statistical significance (t-test p<0.05). The universality score combines these factors (30% breadth + 30% consistency + 20% effect + 20% significance). Section 1.0 catalogs tissue coverage, Section 2.0 presents top universal candidates ranked by composite score, Section 3.0 profiles tissue-specific changes for lead markers, Section 4.0 explores unexpected patterns challenging conventional aging hypotheses.

## 4.0 Unexpected Patterns & Novel Findings

¶1 **Ordering principle:** Known markers → Tissue-specific paradoxes → Dark horse candidates.

### 4.1 Expected Universal Markers: Reality Check

Classical aging markers previously reported as "universal" in literature:

| Gene | Detected? | N_Tissues | Consistency | Mean Δz | Reality vs Expectation |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------|---------|------------------------|
| COL1A1 | Yes | 10 | 60% | -0.044 | ⚠️ Tissue-specific |
| COL1A2 | Yes | 10 | 70% | -0.148 | ✅ Confirmed |
| FN1 | Yes | 10 | 50% | +0.136 | ⚠️ Tissue-specific |
| COL3A1 | Yes | 10 | 67% | -0.226 | ⚠️ Tissue-specific |
| COL4A1 | Yes | 8 | 50% | +0.055 | ⚠️ Tissue-specific |
| COL4A2 | Yes | 9 | 56% | -0.007 | ⚠️ Tissue-specific |
| TIMP1 | Yes | 5 | 60% | +0.110 | ⚠️ Tissue-specific |
| MMP2 | Yes | 5 | 60% | +0.436 | ⚠️ Tissue-specific |
| LAMA5 | Yes | 10 | 60% | -0.081 | ⚠️ Tissue-specific |
| LAMB1 | Yes | 10 | 80% | -0.364 | ✅ Confirmed |
| LAMB2 | Yes | 11 | 55% | -0.234 | ⚠️ Tissue-specific |
| DCN | Yes | 10 | 60% | +0.019 | ⚠️ Tissue-specific |
| BGN | Yes | 10 | 55% | +0.066 | ⚠️ Tissue-specific |


**Key Findings:**
- Several "textbook" universal markers show strong tissue-specific variation
- Absence of detection may reflect study bias toward specific tissue types
- True universality requires validation across ≥10 diverse tissue compartments

### 4.2 Tissue-Specific Paradoxes

Proteins present in MANY tissues but with INCONSISTENT directions (aging context-dependence):

| Gene | Protein | N_Tissues | Consistency% | N_Up | N_Down |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LAMB2 | Laminin subunit beta-2 | 11 | 55 | 5 | 6 |
| ITIH4 | Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4;70 kDa inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4;35 kDa inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 | 10 | 50 | 6 | 6 |
| PLG | Plasminogen;Plasmin heavy chain A;Activation peptide;Angiostatin;Plasmin heavy chain A, short form;Plasmin light chain B | 10 | 50 | 5 | 5 |
| POSTN | Periostin | 10 | 55 | 6 | 5 |
| AGRN | Agrin;Agrin N-terminal 110 kDa subunit;Agrin C-terminal 110 kDa subunit;Agrin C-terminal 90 kDa fragment;Agrin C-terminal 22 kDa fragment | 10 | 58 | 5 | 7 |
| FN1 | Fibronectin;Anastellin;Ugl-Y1;Ugl-Y2;Ugl-Y3 | 10 | 50 | 6 | 6 |
| DPT | Dermatopontin | 10 | 50 | 5 | 5 |
| LGALS1 | Galectin-1 | 10 | 50 | 5 | 5 |
| NID1 | Nidogen-1 | 10 | 50 | 5 | 5 |
| BGN | Biglycan | 10 | 55 | 5 | 6 |

**Interpretation:** These proteins demonstrate context-dependent ECM remodeling—upregulated in some aging tissues while downregulated in others. This suggests tissue-specific aging programs rather than universal mechanisms.


### 4.3 Dark Horse Candidates

Proteins in FEW tissues but with PERFECT consistency + large effects (overlooked universal markers?):

| Gene | Protein | N_Tissues | Consistency% | Direction | Mean|Δz| | Category |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hp | nan | 4 | 100 | UP | 1.785 | Non-ECM |
| FAM120A | Constitutive coactivator of PPAR-gamma-like protein 1 OS=Homo sapiens GN=FAM120A PE=1 SV=2 | 2 | 100 | DOWN | 1.648 | Unknown |
| PRG4 | Proteoglycan 4;Proteoglycan 4 C-terminal part | 4 | 100 | UP | 1.549 | Proteoglycans |
| IL17B | Interleukin-17B | 3 | 100 | DOWN | 1.422 | Secreted Factors |
| RAB32 | Ras-related protein Rab-32 OS=Homo sapiens GN=RAB32 PE=1 SV=3 | 2 | 100 | UP | 1.421 | Unknown |
| Angptl7 | nan | 3 | 100 | UP | 1.357 | Secreted Factors |
| ARF6 | ADP-ribosylation factor 6 OS=Homo sapiens GN=ARF6 PE=1 SV=2 | 2 | 100 | DOWN | 1.196 | Unknown |
| OPLAH | 5-oxoprolinase OS=Homo sapiens GN=OPLAH PE=1 SV=3 | 2 | 100 | UP | 1.061 | Unknown |
| Myoc | nan | 4 | 100 | UP | 1.019 | Non-ECM |
| TBRG4 | Protein TBRG4 OS=Homo sapiens GN=TBRG4 PE=1 SV=1 | 2 | 100 | UP | 1.012 | Unknown |

**Interpretation:** These proteins show remarkably consistent aging signatures despite limited tissue coverage in current datasets. They represent HIGH-PRIORITY candidates for validation in additional tissue types—if consistent across ≥10 tissues, they could be the true "holy grail" universal markers.

**Recommendation:** Prioritize these for targeted proteomics in missing tissue types (brain, heart, liver, skin).

**Proteins predominantly downregulated:** 2374 (71.6%)

---

## 6.0 Conclusions & Therapeutic Implications

### 6.1 Key Discoveries

1. **True universal markers are rare:** Only 405 proteins (12.2%) meet strict universality criteria across ≥3 tissues with ≥70% consistency.

2. **Top 5 candidates** (Hp, VTN, Col14a1, F2, FGB) represent the strongest evidence for pan-tissue ECM aging mechanisms.

3. **Tissue-specific aging dominates:** 1219 proteins show context-dependent changes, suggesting organ-specific aging programs override universal signals.

4. **Dark horse candidates** merit urgent validation—perfect consistency in limited tissues suggests sampling bias rather than true tissue-specificity.

### 6.2 Biological Interpretation

**Why universal markers are rare:**
- ECM composition is highly tissue-specific (cartilage vs kidney vs skin)
- Aging triggers different adaptive responses per organ (fibrosis vs atrophy vs calcification)
- Mechanical stress varies by tissue, driving divergent remodeling
- Species differences (human vs mouse) introduce variability

**What makes a protein universal:**
- Core structural role across all tissues (e.g., basement membrane components)
- Response to systemic aging signals (e.g., inflammation, oxidative stress)
- Fundamental remodeling pathway (e.g., collagen crosslinking enzymes)

### 6.3 Therapeutic Implications

**High-priority targets (multi-tissue impact):**
- **Hp:** 4 tissues, 100% consistency, inhibition may slow multi-organ aging
- **VTN:** 10 tissues, 80% consistency, inhibition may slow multi-organ aging
- **Col14a1:** 6 tissues, 100% consistency, restoration may reverse multi-organ aging
- **F2:** 13 tissues, 79% consistency, inhibition may slow multi-organ aging
- **FGB:** 10 tissues, 90% consistency, inhibition may slow multi-organ aging


**Tissue-specific targets (personalized medicine):**
- Proteins with <60% consistency represent opportunities for organ-specific interventions
- Example: Kidney fibrosis therapies may differ from disc degeneration treatments

**Validation priorities:**
1. Confirm top 10 universal candidates in independent cohorts
2. Test dark horse candidates in missing tissue types (expand from 17 to ≥15 tissues)
3. Functional validation: Does modulating these proteins reverse aging phenotypes?
