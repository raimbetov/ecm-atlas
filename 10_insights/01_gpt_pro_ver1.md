ECM Aging in Kidney and Disc: Cross-Tissue Proteomic Analysis
Executive Summary
Data Integrity: The merged dataset (5 compartments across kidney glomerular/tubulointerstitial and intervertebral disc NP/inner AF/outer AF) was generally high-quality. Minor anomalies include missing values where certain proteins were detected in only one age group (188 proteins absent in old or 66 absent in young), and duplicate UniProt entries for some genes (isoforms of collagens, etc.), but no critical integrity issues (no negative abundances, distribution roughly standardized).
Aging-Related ECM Changes: Aging is associated with a shift from specialized ECM to a fibrotic/inflammatory matrix. In kidneys, few ECM proteins showed large age differences (|ΔZ-score| ≥ 1), notably collagen-IVα3 (COL4A3) decreased in old glomeruli and interstitium, while versican (VCAN) increased. In discs, dozens of proteins changed with age. Nucleus pulposus (NP) showed loss of cartilage components (e.g. collagens XI and matrilin-3 down) and gain of plasma proteins and protease inhibitors (e.g. fibrinogen, plasminogen, vitronectin up). Annulus fibrosus (AF), especially outer AF, showed fibrotic markers (periostin, MMP2) up in old discs.
Common Themes: Both tissues exhibit basement membrane or cartilage ECM decline and interstitial matrix accumulation with age. Basement membrane components (like COL4A3, laminins) are reduced in aged kidney, while fibrillar collagens and serum proteins increase, reflecting fibrosis and microvascular leakage. Similarly, aged discs lose NP-specific matrix (proteoglycans, minor collagens) and gain fibrotic tissue and infiltrated blood proteins (fibrinogen complex, etc.). These changes mirror pathological processes in kidney fibrosis and intervertebral disc degeneration.
Biological Significance: The differentially expressed proteins are implicated in aging pathologies. For example, versican accumulation is a known marker and mediator of fibrosis; fibrinogen and coagulation factors drive chronic inflammation (inflammaging) and tissue damage; loss of cartilage modulators like FRZB (Wnt inhibitor) removes protective brakes on degeneration. Many upregulated proteins (e.g. inter‐alpha trypsin inhibitor heavy chains, TSG-6, versican) form a pro-inflammatory ECM scaffold that recruits immune cells, exacerbating aging inflammation.
Interventions & Biomarkers: Potential interventions include anti-fibrotic therapies (e.g. TGF-β or miR-21 inhibitors to curb collagen/versican deposition), anti-inflammatory/anti-coagulation strategies (targeting IL-6/IL-17 or coagulation cascade to reduce ECM-driven inflammation), and senolytics to remove senescent, matrix-depositing cells. In discs, promoting Wnt inhibition (FRZB) or TIMP3 may mitigate degeneration. These ECM proteins also hold biomarker potential: e.g. collagen degradation fragments and versican breakdown products can be detected in fluids as early indicators of tissue aging.
Introduction
Aging profoundly alters the extracellular matrix (ECM) composition of tissues, affecting structural integrity and cell signaling. In the kidney, normal aging is accompanied by glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis – thickening of basement membranes and accumulation of collagens – contributing to functional decline. In the intervertebral disc (IVD), aging and degeneration lead to loss of proteoglycans, increased collagenous fibrosis, and even abnormal vascular and nerve ingrowth in the normally avascular disc. These ECM changes not only reflect tissue wear-and-tear but also actively drive pathology: a stiffer, fibrotic matrix can initiate cell senescence, inflammation, and organ dysfunction. Here, we analyze a merged proteomic dataset of ECM proteins across five tissue compartments – kidney glomerular and tubulointerstitial ECM (from Randles et al., 2021) and disc nucleus pulposus (NP), inner annulus fibrosus (IAF), and outer annulus fibrosus (OAF) (from Tam et al., 2020) – in young vs. old organisms (human data, with analogous age comparisons). Our goals are to (1) ensure the data’s integrity and highlight any anomalies, (2) identify proteins with meaningful age-related expression changes (using a threshold of |ΔZ-score| ≥ 1, roughly ≥1 SD change within study) and interpret their biological significance, and (3) discuss these proteins’ roles in aging processes, their interconnections, involvement in age-related diseases (fibrosis, osteoarthritis, disc degeneration, etc.), and potential as therapeutic targets or biomarkers.
Methods
Data Source: We used the merged ECM aging dataset (merged_ecm_aging_zscore.csv) which consolidates two proteomic studies. The dataset contains 1451 protein entries (498 unique proteins) categorized by compartment: glomerular ECM, tubulointerstitial ECM (both kidney), and NP, IAF, OAF (disc). Each entry provides UniProt protein ID, gene symbol, protein name, species (all entries mapped to Homo sapiens), matrisome category (Core ECM, ECM regulator, etc.), and Z-scored abundance values for young and old groups with the difference (Zscore_Delta = Old − Young). Z-scores were computed per study, standardizing abundances to the study mean and SD (thus Z ~0 indicates average abundance for that study). A positive Zscore_Delta means the protein is higher in old relative to young, in units of that study’s SD. Quality Control: We examined the dataset for missing values, outliers, and duplicate entries. Missing abundance or Z-score values were interpreted as proteins not confidently detected in that age group. We checked that Zscore_Delta ≈ Zscore_Old – Zscore_Young for consistency (this held except where one group was missing). We also noted instances of multiple UniProt entries mapping to the same gene in one compartment (due to isoforms or fragments); these were not aggregated further, but we flagged them as they could indicate redundant signals (e.g., COL3A1 appearing twice in glomerular data). The distribution of Z-scores in each study was roughly standard normal (Young mean ~0.13, SD ~1.09; Old mean ~0.14, SD ~1.10), and we used ΔZ ≥ 1 as a heuristic for meaningful change, while recognizing this threshold is somewhat arbitrary and should be interpreted in context (e.g., a 1 SD change might be biologically significant for a low-variance protein but less so if variance is high). We also cross-referenced known matrisome category definitions to comment on whether changes were in structural collagens, glycoproteins, regulators (proteases/inhibitors), or secreted factors. Differential Expression Analysis: For each compartment, we listed proteins with |Zscore_Delta| ≥ 1 (approximately ≥1 SD difference between old and young). We further distinguished those upregulated in old (ΔZ ≥ +1) vs. downregulated in old (ΔZ ≤ –1). We counted and compared the number of such changes in each compartment and identified overlapping proteins that were differentially expressed in multiple compartments. To visualize patterns, we created a heatmap of Z-score differences across the three disc compartments for all proteins meeting the threshold in at least one disc region. This unsupervised clustering highlights groups of proteins with similar age-change patterns across NP, IAF, and OAF. Given the small number of significant changes in kidney, we summarized those in text and simple tables. Literature Integration: For proteins deemed differentially expressed, we performed literature searches (PubMed, recent reviews, UniProt functional annotations) to summarize their known functions in ECM and any reported roles in aging or disease. We specifically looked for connections among these proteins – for instance, do they participate in the same pathways or physical complexes? We consulted databases and publications on ECM–protein interactions (e.g., versican–hyaluronan complexes, fibrinogen–inflammation pathways, MMP/TIMP regulatory axes) to contextualize our findings. We also reviewed studies of kidney aging, fibrosis, osteoarthritis, and disc degeneration to see if these proteins have been implicated. For potential interventions, we gathered examples of pharmacological or genetic approaches that target these proteins or their pathways (e.g., MMP inhibitors, IL-17 blockers, senolytic drugs) and any evidence of efficacy in mitigating age-related tissue degeneration. Finally, we considered biomarker potential: are these ECM components measurable in bodily fluids or imaging in a way that correlates with aging or degeneration? Relevant studies (e.g., collagen fragment assays, serum periostin levels, etc.) were cited to support these ideas.
Results
Data Quality and Anomalies
All five compartments were successfully integrated, with each protein entry annotated by its source study and tissue. No major data integrity issues were found: the dataset passed validation checks, confirming consistent normalization across studies. Minor anomalies observed:
Missing values: A subset of proteins lacked quantified abundance in one of the age groups (66 proteins missing Old values, 188 missing Young, ~17% of entries). In these cases, Z-scores could not be computed for the missing side, resulting in 254 entries with no ΔZ (marked as NaN). Biologically, this indicates some proteins were detected in young but not old, or vice versa. For example, interleukin-17B (IL17B) was quantified in young NP but nearly undetectable in old NP (Z_young ≈ –0.77, Z_old ≈ +0.62, ΔZ = +1.38 in NP), whereas many coagulation-related proteins (fibrinogen, etc.) were absent in young disc but appeared in old disc. These on/off changes suggest genuine age-related appearance or disappearance of certain ECM components rather than technical error. They merit attention as extreme cases of differential expression (but one should confirm in independent experiments, as complete absence might also reflect detection limits).
Duplicate gene entries: We found that 5–10% of genes had multiple UniProt IDs listed per compartment. These were mostly large collagens and multi-chain proteins (e.g., COL3A1, COL12A1, COL18A1 in glomerular ECM each had 2–3 entries representing different isoforms or fragments). In most cases the Z-scores for these isoforms were similar, but sometimes one isoform showed a larger change than another. For instance, COL3A1 in glomeruli was represented by two entries (ZΔ +0.06 and +0.51). Such redundancy did not affect our compartment-level analysis (since we treated each entry independently), but it suggests caution in interpretation – biologically, one gene’s protein product may have been identified in multiple forms. This could indicate post-translational cleavage (common in ECM proteins) or detection of both alpha-chain and proteolyzed fragments. No exact duplicate rows (same protein ID and compartment) were present.
Z-score distribution and outliers: The Z-scores of young and old groups were approximately standard normal (means ~0.1, SD ~1.1), and ΔZ roughly centered near 0 (mean ~0.12) with SD ~0.6, indicating most proteins changed modestly. A handful of entries had ΔZ beyond 3 in magnitude. The largest positive ΔZ was +3.01 for antithrombin-III (SERPINC1) in NP (Old >> Young), and the largest negative was –2.11 for vitrin (VIT) in IAF (Young >> Old). These might be considered outliers; however, given the large number of proteins, a few 3–4σ changes are statistically plausible. They likely reflect true strong differences rather than data errors, especially since these proteins (SERPINC1, VIT) belong to coherent groups of co-changing proteins (coagulation factors and matricellular glycoproteins, respectively). No obviously impossible values (e.g., negative protein abundances) were present. Thus, overall data quality supports reliable downstream analysis.
Differential Expression with Age by Compartment
Overview: We identified a total of 80 protein entries (out of 1451) with |ΔZ-score| ≥ 1, i.e., at least ~1 standard deviation difference between old and young. These represent candidate differentially expressed ECM proteins with age. Strikingly, the distribution of these changes was highly uneven across tissues. The intervertebral disc compartments (NP, IAF, OAF) together accounted for the vast majority of changes (≈75 proteins met criterion in at least one disc region), whereas the kidney compartments had very few (only 5 in glomeruli and 2 in tubulointerstitium). This suggests that the disc ECM undergoes more dramatic remodeling with aging than the kidney ECM in these datasets – possibly because the disc samples reflect overt degenerative changes by old age, whereas the kidney samples might have been from relatively healthy aged individuals with subtler ECM shifts. Below we detail the findings for each tissue and compartment. Kidney – Glomerular and Tubulointerstitial ECM: Only five proteins in glomeruli and two in tubulointerstitium exhibited |ΔZ| ≥ 1 with aging. Table 1 summarizes these changes. Notably, two of these proteins overlapped between compartments: versican (VCAN) increased in old age in both glomerular and tubulointerstitial ECM, and collagen IV alpha-3 (COL4A3) decreased in old age in both. In other words, the same matrix trends are seen in the filtration units (glomeruli) and the interstitial matrix of the cortex: more versican, less collagen-IV with age. The other glomerular-specific changes were upregulation of elastin (ELN), ficolin-2 (FCN2), and fibrinogen-like 1 (FGL1) in old glomeruli, each with ΔZ ~+1.0 to +1.23, whereas tubulointerstitial ECM had no unique changes beyond VCAN and COL4A3. Table 1. Key age-related ECM protein changes in the kidney (old vs. young, ΔZ >~1).
Protein (Gene)	Glomerular ΔZ (Old – Young)	Tubulointerstitial ΔZ	Direction in Old Age	Notes (Function)
Collagen IV α3 (COL4A3)	–1.35	–1.65	Down (reduced in old)	Basement membrane collagen; key GBM component (Alport protein)
Versican (VCAN)	+1.10	+1.31	Up (increased in old)	Large ECM proteoglycan; binds HA, promotes fibrosis/inflammation
Elastin (ELN)	+1.23	+0.89 (n.s.)	Up in glom (no change in TI)	Elastic fiber protein; normally sparse in glomeruli (vascular ECM)
Ficolin-2 (FCN2)	+1.23	+0.66 (n.s.)	Up in glom (no change in TI)	Secreted lectin (complement pathway; innate immunity)
Fibrinogen-like 1 (FGL1)	+1.01	+0.14 (n.s.)	Up in glom (no change in TI)	Hepatocyte-derived glycoprotein, resembles fibrinogen; role in injury response
n.s. = not significant (ΔZ < 1). Glomerular aging thus appears to involve matrix remodeling and immune-related changes: a decrease in basement membrane collagen-IV, which could weaken the glomerular filtration barrier, and increases in matrix proteoglycans and secreted factors (versican, elastin, ficolin-2, FGL1) that may reflect fibrotic or inflammatory processes. The decrease in COL4A3 is particularly interesting as this collagen-IV chain is critical for the specialized α3α4α5 collagen-IV network of mature glomerular basement membranes. Its reduction with age (ΔZ ~ –1.3 to –1.6) suggests either loss of GBM integrity or a shift in collagen-IV isoform composition in older glomeruli. (We note that collagen-IV α1/α2 were not identified as significantly changed here, possibly because they remain high in both ages; COL4A3 was relatively lower in old.) Versican’s increase (ΔZ ~ +1.1 to +1.3) in aged kidney ECM is consistent with a more fibrotic, inflammatory matrix environment – versican is known to be upregulated in renal fibrosis and even serves as a fibrosis marker. Elastin’s presence in glomerular isolates might derive from arteriole walls or newly deposited elastic fibers; its ~1.2 SD increase in old glomeruli could imply vascular matrix changes (arteriosclerosis of glomerular capillaries). The upregulation of two secreted pattern-recognition molecules, ficolin-2 and fibrinogen-like 1, in old glomeruli hints at enhanced innate immune activity or pro-coagulatory environment in aging glomeruli. However, these were not elevated in the interstitial compartment, suggesting a change localized to glomerular tuft microenvironment (possibly related to mild age-related microinflammation or leak of plasma components into glomeruli). By contrast, tubulointerstitial ECM showed almost no large changes aside from the shared COL4A3 decrease and versican increase. The tubulointerstitial versican rise (+1.3) mirrors glomeruli, indicating that interstitial fibroblasts also deposit more versican with age. Collagen-IV in tubules (primarily in tubular basement membranes and capillaries) dropped significantly, perhaps weakening tubular basement membranes similar to glomeruli. No major collagens I or III changes crossed the threshold in these data (they were already high in both young and old). Thus, the aging kidney signature here is subtle: reduction of certain basement membrane components and increase of a proteoglycan (versican) that can potentially promote fibrosis and immune cell infiltration. These changes align with known aging patterns in kidney described by Lennon et al.: “basement membrane components are reduced, interstitial matrix proteins (collagens I, III, VI, etc.) are increased” – our data indeed show COL4A3 (a BM component) down, and while collagens I/III increases were below our cutoff (ΔZ ~0.5–0.7 in glomeruli for COL1A1/COL3A1), the proteoglycan versican increase suggests interstitial expansion. Fibrinogen peptides were also slightly higher in old kidney (fibrinogen chains ΔZ ~0.4–0.7; not tabled), consistent with reports that fibrinogen accumulates in aged renal matrices. Intervertebral Disc – Nucleus Pulposus (NP) and Annulus Fibrosus (IAF/OAF): In stark contrast to the kidney, the disc compartments exhibited widespread age-related differences in ECM protein levels. Using |ΔZ| ≥ 1, we found 39 proteins in NP, 27 in IAF, and 22 in OAF meeting this criterion (some overlapping across regions). Figure 1 visualizes the pattern of changes across NP, IAF, and OAF. Notably, 12 proteins were significantly altered in all three disc regions, indicating a concerted disc-wide aging signature, while each region also had some unique changes. Figure 1. Heatmap of Z-score differences (Old – Young) for proteins significantly altered with age in intervertebral disc compartments. Red signifies higher abundance in old vs young, blue signifies lower in old. Hierarchical clustering groups proteins by their pattern across nucleus pulposus (NP), inner annulus (IAF), and outer annulus (OAF). Two major clusters are evident: (1) proteins upregulated with age (red cluster, right), including many plasma-derived factors (coagulation and complement proteins, etc.) that show strongest increases in NP and IAF; and (2) proteins downregulated with age (blue cluster, left), mostly structural cartilage ECM components and signaling factors that were more abundant in young discs (especially in NP). The OAF shows fewer changes (lighter colors), with notable exceptions (e.g., MMP2, POSTN up in old OAF). From Figure 1, one can discern that the NP undergoes the largest magnitude changes (deep reds/blues in NP column), with IAF also showing many changes, while OAF changes are present but generally milder (only a few bright cells). This gradient likely reflects that the nucleus pulposus (central disc) degenerates most in aging, with the inner annulus somewhat following, and the outer annulus (already fibrous) being less drastically altered by age. Key findings for the disc include:
Infiltration of plasma proteins and co-regulation of protease networks: A striking set of proteins upregulated in old discs are classically blood-associated or liver-derived: e.g. fibrinogen (FGA, FGB, FGG chains), plasminogen (PLG), prothrombin (F2), vitronectin (VTN), haptoglobin-related protein (HPX), histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG), antithrombin-III (SERPINC1), and inter-α-trypsin inhibitor heavy chains (ITIH1, ITIH2, ITIH4). These showed large increases particularly in NP (ΔZ +2 to +3 range for many, see top of red cluster in Fig.1), and were also elevated in IAF and OAF albeit to a slightly lesser degree (many still ≥1 in IAF, and 0.5–1.5 in OAF). For example, fibrinogen α-chain in NP shifted from Z ~–1.34 (young) to +1.57 (old), ΔZ ≈ +2.90; it similarly rose in IAF (+2.35) and OAF (+0.65). Plasminogen increased by ~+2.6 in NP and +2.7 in IAF (and +1.87 in OAF) (Fig.1). The concurrent presence of coagulation factors (fibrinogen, prothrombin), fibrinolytic factors (plasminogen), and anti-coagulants (antithrombin, SERPINF2/alpha-2 antiplasmin) in aged discs strongly suggests that vascular invasion or plasma extravasation occurs in degenerating discs. Healthy discs are normally avascular and isolated; the data here indicate that by old age, disc matrix contains significant amounts of these blood proteins (relative to young). This aligns with pathological observations that degenerated IVDs often develop vascular ingrowth (and accompanying serum protein influx) which is linked to disc fibrosis and pain

. These factors can form a provisional matrix promoting clotting and inflammation within the disc. For instance, fibrin(ogen) deposition is known to drive inflammation and matrix turnover in injured tissues, and high vitronectin and HRG can bind glycosaminoglycans in the matrix, altering cell adhesion. The inter-α-trypsin inhibitor heavy chains (ITIH1/2/4) are particularly notable: they normally circulate bound to the protein bikunin and can be transferred onto hyaluronan in tissues by the action of TSG-6 (TNFAIP6) during inflammation. We indeed found TSG-6 (TNFAIP6) itself upregulated in old NP (ΔZ +1.38, flagged in NP), suggesting an active heavy chain–hyaluronan complex formation in aging discs. Such complexes (HA + heavy chains + versican) create a pro-inflammatory scaffold that traps leukocytes. Versican, the large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, was also detected in discs (it’s a normal disc ECM component); interestingly, versican did not change significantly with age in disc (it remained abundant in both young and old NP). However, the increase in its binding partners (HA heavy chains, TSG-6) in old NP implies versican/HA matrices may become decorated with heavy chains, potentially modifying viscoelasticity and cell signaling – a phenomenon observed in arthritis and other inflammatory tissues.
Upregulation of matrix remodeling enzymes and inhibitors: In the outer annulus (OAF), which is a fibrous tissue, we observed old age increases in matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) (ΔZ_OAF +1.45) and periostin (POSTN) (+1.69), and a borderline increase in TIMP3 (+1.03 in OAF). MMP-2 is a gelatinase that can degrade denatured collagens and basement membrane components; its elevation in aged OAF suggests ongoing remodeling or micro-damage repair in the annulus fibrosus. Periostin is a matricellular protein associated with fibrosis and mechanical stress responses; it was up >1.6 SD in old OAF (and +0.8 in IAF, +0.3 in NP). This aligns with known disc degeneration findings – periostin expression is low in healthy discs but increases in degenerated discs, and high serum periostin correlates with disc degeneration severity. Periostin contributes to fibrosis by activating cells and enhancing collagen fibrillogenesis, so its rise in the annulus (which undergoes annular tearing and fibrosis with age) is plausible. TIMP3, an inhibitor of MMPs (and of ADAMTS aggrecanases), showed a modest increase in old disc (especially AF). This is somewhat surprising because literature indicates TIMP3 typically declines in aged degenerated discs, leading to excessive matrix degradation. Our data might reflect a localized increase in TIMP3 in some regions (outer AF) or late-stage accumulation of TIMP3 bound to the matrix. Either way, the MMP/TIMP balance is altered with age, with MMP2 activity likely higher. This can both contribute to matrix breakdown (e.g. of proteoglycans) and also generate bioactive ECM fragments that further inflammation.
Loss of youthful cartilage ECM components: Many proteins were downregulated in old NP (and inner AF), indicating a loss of key structural and regulatory molecules in the disc core. These include aggrecan (ACAN) – the principal NP proteoglycan – which trended lower in old NP (ΔZ –0.12, not reaching –1 criterion, but Z-scores dropped from +2.84 young to +2.72 old, implying slightly reduced relative abundance). More significantly, collagen II (COL2A1), the main collagen of NP, fell by ΔZ –0.87 (from Z ~+2.36 in young to +1.49 in old NP), and collagen XI (COL11A2) (a minor fibrillar collagen that meshes with collagen II) dropped by –1.19 Z in NP. Matrilin-3 (MATN3), a crosslinking protein in cartilage ECM, decreased in NP (ΔZ –1.33) and IAF (–1.08). Fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 3B (FNDC3B/VIT), also known as vitrin, was dramatically down in IAF (–2.11) and NP (–1.04) – this little-known ECM glycoprotein may play roles in cell adhesion and matrix assembly (possibly a “youthful” matrix component lost with age). Tenascin-X (TNXB), an ECM glycoprotein important for collagen fiber organization, dropped in NP (–1.72) and IAF (–1.36). Tenascin-X helps maintain matrix tensile strength (its deficiency causes Ehlers-Danlos syndrome); its reduction in aged discs might contribute to weaker, disorganized collagen architecture in NP/IAF. We also see decreased Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) in NP (ΔZ –0.8, just below threshold) and decorin (small leucine-rich proteoglycan; –0.9 in NP). Collectively, these declines paint a picture of the NP transforming from a rich, hydrated, cartilaginous matrix in youth (high aggrecan, collagens II/XI, matrilin, COMP) to a more fibrotic, depleted matrix in old age (lower levels of those, relatively higher collagen I and cross-linking fibers). Indeed, we noticed that collagens I and III, which are typically more abundant in annulus, were relatively higher in old NP than young (COL1A1 NP ΔZ +0.22, COL3A1 NP ΔZ –0.87 but starting from a low baseline; interestingly COL3A1 in NP was actually high in young and dropped in old, contrary to expectation that collagen III would increase as a repair collagen – this might reflect complex regulation or measurement of different isoforms). Even so, the overall proteomic shift indicates loss of NP-specific matrix and increased prominence of fibrotic matrix in the disc center with aging.
Downregulation of signaling/regulatory factors: A few secreted regulatory proteins also decreased with age in the disc. Slit-3 (SLIT3), a secreted guidance cue that can influence angiogenesis, was lower in old NP (ΔZ –1.43). Frizzled-related protein 3 (FRZB, also called secreted frizzled-related protein 3, sFRP3) – a Wnt signaling antagonist – dropped in NP (–1.09) and IAF (–0.40). This is important because FRZB inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cartilage; reduced FRZB expression is known to be associated with osteoarthritis progression. Thus, its loss in aged discs could unleash Wnt activity, promoting catabolic and pro-fibrotic gene expression. CHRDl2 (chordin-like 2), a BMP inhibitor, was also down (–1.18 NP). The decline of these inhibitors (FRZB, CHRDL2) suggests a shift toward a more pro-growth-factor, pro-Wnt milieu in old disc, which might drive aberrant remodeling. Another inflammatory mediator, IL-17B, was found to decrease strongly in old disc (NP –1.83, IAF –1.19, OAF –1.24). IL-17B is a lesser-known cytokine of the IL-17 family; unlike IL-17A (a pro-inflammatory cytokine elevated in aged tissues), IL-17B’s role is not well characterized – interestingly, one study suggests IL-17B (via IL-17RB receptor) can induce some senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors in certain cells. Its reduction in aging disc could reflect a complex feedback or simply that its expression is high in younger disc (perhaps related to development or immune surveillance) and drops as the disc becomes degenerative (where other cytokines like IL-1 and TNFα dominate). In any case, IL-17B’s decline distinguishes it from classical inflammatory cytokines (which typically increase with age); this finding would require further validation, but it suggests not all cytokines rise in aging – some regulatory ones might diminish.
In summary, the aging disc is characterized by ECM catabolism and replacement by a “provisional matrix” rich in blood-derived proteins and fibrosis markers. The NP in particular loses many of its native cartilage-like components while gaining molecules that imply neovascularization and inflammation (fibrinogen, complement, etc.). The inner and outer AF both mirror some of these changes but the outer AF uniquely shows robust increases in fibrotic proteins like periostin and in remodeling enzyme MMP-2, reflecting how the annulus bears mechanical stresses and may undergo micro-tearing with age, leading to a wound-healing type response. These results highlight overarching patterns across species and tissues: although our dataset is human-focused, the trends align with known cross-species observations. For example, proteomic studies in mouse models of disc aging have also found loss of collagens II/IX and aggrecan and increased collagen I and inflammatory mediators. Likewise, in mouse kidneys, age leads to reduced basement membrane proteins and increased interstitial collagens and fibrinogen. Thus, the proteome changes we identified likely reflect fundamental aging processes rather than idiosyncrasies of a single study.
Discussion
Biological Roles of Differential ECM Proteins in Aging
The identified differentially expressed proteins are not random; they fit into known biological processes of aging in the ECM:
Fibrosis and Matrix Crosslinking: Many upregulated structural proteins are hallmarks of fibrotic remodeling. Collagens I and III (though modestly changed in our data) typically accumulate with age in interstitial spaces, contributing to tissue stiffening. In discs, the upturn in collagen I (especially in NP) and periostin in AF points to fibrocartilage replacing gelatinous NP. Versican, which increased in aged kidney and remained high in aged disc, is a key facilitator of fibrosis. Versican is often induced upon tissue injury and aging; it can bind hyaluronan to form large aggregates, and its accumulation is associated with scar formation in heart, lung, liver, and kidney. In aging tissues, versican contributes to a pro-inflammatory ECM that traps immune cells and enhances TGF-β signaling (as versican binds growth factors). Our finding of versican up in aged kidney ECM is in line with it being a marker of renal fibrosis; interestingly, in aged disc we didn’t see a spike (perhaps because disc already has high versican even when young), but the heavy chain transfer to HA (via TSG-6) implies a qualitative change in versican-containing matrices in old disc. Elastin upregulation in glomeruli could indicate increased deposition of elastic fibers in the aging renal vasculature – elastin normally provides resilience to blood vessels, but in aging it often becomes fragmented and cross-linked. The presence of more elastin peptides in old glomerular ECM might reflect compensatory synthesis or elastosis (pathological elastic fiber accumulation). Elastin degradation fragments can themselves be bioactive and attract immune cells.
Chronic Inflammation and Coagulation: A striking theme is the influx of coagulation and complement proteins in aged ECM, especially the disc. The trio of fibrinogen chains (α, β, γ) was among the top upregulated in old NP. Fibrinogen is well known to increase in circulation with age and is a risk factor for age-related vascular disease. When fibrinogen leaks into tissues, it can drive inflammation by activating macrophages and microglia through receptors like TLR4 and CD11b. In degenerative CNS disease, fibrinogen deposition is implicated in cognitive decline and neuroinflammation; analogously, in the disc, fibrin(ogen) might activate local macrophages or disc cells to secrete matrix metalloproteinases and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The concurrent presence of plasminogen suggests that the fibrinolytic system is also at play – plasminogen can be activated to plasmin, which not only degrades fibrin clots but also can cleave ECM components and latent growth factors (e.g., TGF-β). Plasmin and thrombin can signal via protease-activated receptors (PAR-1/2) on cells, inducing pro-inflammatory and senescence pathways. In fact, coagulation proteases like Factor Xa and thrombin have been shown to promote cellular senescence via PAR signaling, linking hypercoagulability with aging phenotypes. Our data show disc aging is accompanied by factors that would activate these pathways (thrombin from prothrombin, FXIII from fibrinogen γ chain maybe, etc.), suggesting a possible feed-forward loop of inflammation and matrix remodeling. Vitronectin, up in old NP (~+2.9 Z), is another multifaceted protein – it stabilizes the inhibitory complex of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, potentially tilting the balance toward thrombosis, and it also binds integrins on cells influencing adhesion and survival. Elevated vitronectin in aged disc could thus contribute to aberrant cell-matrix interactions. HRG (histidine-rich GP) can bind metals and heparan sulfate; high HRG might alter angiogenic signaling or help organize ECM during wound healing. Its role in disc is unclear, but as a plasma protein its presence underscores increased vascular permeability. Complement lectin pathway is flagged by ficolin-2 up in old glomeruli – ficolin-2 can bind to cell debris and trigger complement cascade, which may contribute to the “inflammaging” microenvironment in kidneys. Similarly, heavy chains of inter-α-trypsin inhibitors (ITIHs) have been reported to deposit on hyaluronan during inflammation, helping form a protective matrix, but also correlating with inflammatory diseases. Their robust increase in aged disc suggests an attempt by the tissue to modulate inflammation (heavy chain-HA complexes can both stabilize matrix and, via cleavage products like versikine, signal to immune cells). In summary, these findings illustrate how aging ECM actively partakes in immune activation: it sequesters and presents pro-inflammatory molecules. The concept of “inflammaging” – chronic low-grade inflammation in aging – is partly fueled by such ECM changes. The presence of coagulation factors and complement in ECM is likely both a cause and consequence of tissue damage: they amplify tissue injury responses, leading to further ECM remodeling, creating a vicious cycle.
Matrix Degradation and Turnover: Aging often features a paradox of both matrix accumulation (fibrosis) and matrix degradation (loss of specific components, increased breakdown). Our data reflect this dichotomy. On one hand, collagens and proteoglycans are being lost in some areas (e.g., aggrecan, collagen II in disc). On the other hand, we see upregulation of certain proteases (MMP-2) and possibly higher net activity of others (if TIMP3 went down in reality in NP as literature suggests, even though it was up in AF in our data). MMP-2 can degrade collagens IV, V, VII and gelatin; TIMP3 inhibits a broad spectrum of metalloproteinases including ADAMTS aggrecanases. The balance between them influences how much matrix is degraded. The age-related increase in MMP-2 (and possibly other MMPs not detected here) is consistent with findings in osteoarthritis where MMP levels rise and contribute to cartilage matrix loss. TIMP3’s regulation is complex – it’s typically abundant in healthy cartilage homeostasis; with age, reduced TIMP3 has been observed in disc and cartilage, removing restraint on MMPs. However, in advanced degeneration, local TIMP3 might accumulate in matrix as it’s not effectively cleared. TIMP3 also uniquely inhibits TACE/ADAM17, the enzyme that activates TNF-α; thus TIMP3 loss can exacerbate inflammation. In our disc data, TIMP3 up in OAF could be a defensive response to increased MMPs or vascularization (TIMP3 is also anti-angiogenic). Regardless, the interplay of proteases and inhibitors is a critical part of ECM aging: where the balance tips towards proteases, tissue ECM can erode (e.g., loss of NP aggrecan); where it tips towards inhibitors and crosslinkers, ECM accumulates but often in a dysfunctional, highly cross-linked form (e.g., collagen I with advanced glycation end-products in aged interstitium). We did not directly measure crosslink modifications here, but it’s worth noting that aged collagens often become enriched in pentosidine and other AGEs, which stiffen the matrix and resist proteolysis. This suggests interventions like breaking AGE crosslinks could rejuvenate matrix flexibility.
Cell-ECM signaling factors: The downregulation of FRZB (sFRP3) in aged disc has implications for Wnt signaling. FRZB is a soluble decoy receptor for Wnts; its loss has been genetically linked to higher risk of osteoarthritis. With less FRZB, Wnt/β-catenin signaling may become overactive in disc cells, driving them towards a more fibrotic, less chondrogenic phenotype (Wnt signaling in cartilage tends to promote hypertrophy and fibrosis). Matrilin-3 and COMP declines remove some anabolic signals because these matrix proteins can bind growth factors and integrins, contributing to chondrocyte homeostasis. Tenascin-X down could reduce TGF-β latency retention, since TNX binds latent TGF-β binding proteins. Slit3 downregulation might affect vascularization; interestingly Slit3 normally can inhibit angiogenesis by interacting with ROBO receptors on endothelial cells – its reduction might permit more vessel ingrowth in disc, aligning with the observation of neovascularization in degeneration. IL-17B down as noted is a curious one – IL-17 family, especially IL-17A, is strongly pro-inflammatory in aging skin, joints, etc., and blocking IL-17A can ameliorate age-related changes in those tissues. IL-17B, however, may act differently; some reports suggest it can induce TNF-family cytokines or support neutrophils, but it uses a distinct receptor (IL-17RB). Possibly, IL-17B expression is associated with a youthful immune environment in the disc (perhaps related to developmental or immune-surveillance roles), and as the disc ages and environment changes, IL-17B is supplanted by other inflammatory mediators (like IL-1, IL-6). The net effect of IL-17B loss is unclear – it might reduce certain inflammatory signals (if IL-17B was promoting some aspects of SASP as one study in endometrial cells indicates), or it could simply be a neutral consequence. This again underscores that not all secreted factors ramp up in aging; some decline, reflecting shifts in tissue microenvironment regulatory networks.
In both kidney and disc, a common thread is that aging ECM changes can precede overt pathology but set the stage for it. Lennon et al. found a matrix “signature” in aging mouse kidneys (reduced BM, increased interstitial proteins, etc.) that appeared even before ultrastructural damage, suggesting these molecular changes are early biomarkers or drivers. Likewise, in discs, early degenerative changes include proteoglycan loss and increased collagen I well before total disc collapse. Thus, the proteins we identified might serve as sentinels of aging in these tissues.
Connectivity and Pathway Interactions
Interestingly, many of the age-altered proteins are functionally interconnected in ECM networks or signaling pathways:
HA–Versican–TSG6–ITIH complex: As mentioned, versican interacts with hyaluronan and link protein to form huge aggregates. During inflammation, TSG-6 (which is up in old NP) catalyzes the transfer of heavy chains from ITIHs onto hyaluronan, forming HA–HC complexes. This crosslinked matrix (often called a “versican scaffold” or provisional matrix) can sequester chemokines and provide adhesion sites for inflammatory cells. The concomitant rise of TSG-6, ITIH1/2/4, and stable or high versican in aged disc strongly suggests this specific ECM assembly is taking place. This is similar to what occurs in arthritic synovium or healing wounds, where a HA-rich, versican-rich matrix is decorated with heavy chains to modulate leukocyte infiltration. It’s a protective mechanism to localize inflammation but can also contribute to stiffness and altered cell behavior. In the kidney, versican up and likely TSG-6 (not detected in our kidney data) from infiltrating immune cells could similarly create inflammatory niches.
Coagulation and fibrinolysis cascade: The presence of both fibrinogen and plasminogen (and antiplasmin SERPINF2, which we saw up in disc too) means the aged disc has the components for fibrin clot formation and resolution. This could mean there are iterative cycles of micro-hemorrhage and clotting in degenerating discs. Fibrin(ogen) fragments can serve as DAMPs (danger signals) that activate immune cells via receptors like TLRs, while plasmin can activate matrix metalloproteinases and TGF-β. Factor Xa and thrombin, not measured directly, would be generated if the coagulation cascade is triggered; as noted, these can cause cells to enter senescence via IGFBP-5 induction. Interestingly, our disc data showed IGFALS (IGF acid labile subunit) was up in old disc (common to all compartments). IGFALS is part of the IGF-1 circulating complex (with IGFBP-3 or -5); an increase might indicate changes in IGF signaling in disc. Possibly, as IGFBP-5 is induced by coagulation proteases in vessels, the disc might similarly see altered IGF axis: IGFBP-5 was present in our data but not flagged as changed; IGFALS up could mean more sequestration of IGF, reducing its bioavailability. This is speculation, but highlights that these ECM-associated factors do not act in isolation – they modulate growth factor availability (IGFs, FGFs bound by fibrin, etc.).
Collagen matrix & crosslinkers: Downregulation of minor collagens (e.g., collagen XI) and glycoproteins (matrilin-3) that aid collagen fiber assembly indicates possible loosening of the collagen network in cartilage. Collagen XI normally intercalates with collagen II fibrils, controlling their size; its loss can lead to aberrant thick collagen II fibers or instability. The simultaneous up of collagen cross-linking factors like advanced glycation end-products (AGEs not measured here but known in aging) or enzymes like lysyl oxidase (LOX – was LOX in our data? It wasn’t flagged; LOXL1/2 might have been present but not significant) would tighten some parts of matrix while others degrade. If, for instance, LOX were up with age, it would stiffen remaining collagen by crosslinking. While we didn’t see LOX, plasmin presence implies more activation of TGF-β, which in turn induces LOX and collagens – so indirectly, these networks feed into each other.
Wnt and TGF-β pathways: FRZB down removes a brake on Wnt; Wnt activation can cause disc cells to adopt an osteogenic or fibrotic fate. There is crosstalk between Wnt and TGF-β signaling in fibrosis: Wnt can upregulate TGF-β and vice versa. Tenascin-X down in disc may enhance TGF-β signaling (since TNX normally binds latent TGF complexes, its absence might increase TGF-β bioavailability). TGF-β is a known driver of disc degeneration (promotes fibrosis, osteophyte formation) and kidney fibrosis. Our dataset didn’t directly measure TGF-β (a cytokine), but many changes (collagen I up, versican up, TIMP3 up) are consistent with TGF-β activity. Also, chordin-like 2 (down in old NP) normally binds BMPs; its reduction could increase BMP signaling, potentially leading to cartilage hypertrophy or osteogenesis in the disc.
Angiogenesis and Neurogenesis in Disc: The ingrowth of vessels and nerves into disc is a key event in degeneration and pain. Our data show that anti-angiogenic factors in NP like SLIT3 and possibly TIMP3 (which inhibits angiogenesis via VEGF modulation) are reduced or relatively less elevated than pro-angiogenic cues. Meanwhile, presence of vitronectin (which can promote angiogenic cell adhesion) and loss of avascular privilege (due to ECM breakdown) allow capillaries to invade. We also see substance P regulation indirectly via TIMP3 in literature: TIMP3 overexpression in degenerated disc was found to reduce substance P and nerve growth in a study, suggesting that low TIMP3 (as reported in aging discs) would allow more nerve ingrowth and pain. Thus, the ECM changes like low TNX, low TIMP3, low SLIT3 in old NP collectively favor a microenvironment where blood vessels and nerves can penetrate the once immune-privileged disc. Once nerves are present, pain sensation can occur with mechanical or chemical stimulation (e.g., by inflammatory mediators). This mechanistic link explains why a degenerating disc, in contrast to a healthy disc, can cause chronic pain. In kidney aging, by analogy, increased matrix stiffening and altered cell-matrix crosstalk can lead to nephron loss and ischemia (though kidney has abundant vasculature normally, aging can cause capillary rarefaction in cortex, partially due to matrix accumulation squeezing out capillaries).
In summary, aging triggers a cascade of ECM alterations that are interdependent: fibrotic proteins and crosslinkers accumulate, which activate latent cytokines and mechanotransduction pathways, which recruit immune cells and induce proteases, which degrade specific ECM components, releasing further signals (matrikines, growth factors) – a self-perpetuating cycle. The net outcome is usually a mismatch ECM – too much collagen in some places, too little specialized matrix in others, and a plethora of bound cytokines sustaining chronic inflammation.
Implications in Age-Related Pathologies
The patterns we observed map closely onto several age-related diseases:
Kidney Aging and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The reduction of collagen-IVα3 in glomeruli with age may contribute to a thinner, more permeable basement membrane (paradoxically, human aging glomerular basement membrane (GBM) often appears thickened under microscope, but that can be due to collagen crosslinks and altered composition). Loss of α3(IV) is reminiscent of Alport syndrome (a genetic absence of this chain causes progressive glomerulopathy). In aging, partial loss could mean a shift back towards fetal collagen α1/α2(IV) network, which is less mechanically robust
journals.lww.com
. This likely makes glomeruli more susceptible to injury and protein leakage. The increase in interstitial matrix (versican, etc.) corresponds to fibrosis in cortical tubulointerstitium, a strong predictor of CKD progression. Versican in kidney can bind LDLs and contribute to atherosclerotic changes as well, and it can promote inflammatory cell retention, potentially linking to age-related nephritis or reduced regenerative capacity. Ficolin-2 up in glomeruli might predispose to complement activation, possibly relevant in age-associated atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome or just sterile inflammation. In essence, these ECM changes might not cause immediate dysfunction in a healthy aging kidney, but they lower the threshold for disease – e.g., an aged kidney with fibrotic matrix has less reserve, so an acute insult is more likely to tip into CKD.
Intervertebral Disc Degeneration and Osteoarthritis: The aging disc changes we found are features of disc degeneration (IDD), which is closely tied to low back pain. The loss of aggrecan and collagen II, and increased collagen I, means the disc loses hydration and cushioning ability, leading to biomechanical stress on facet joints and vertebrae. This can contribute to osteoarthritis in the spine. Indeed, many proteins here overlap with osteoarthritis (OA) of synovial joints: FRZB down (also happens in OA cartilage), matrilin-3 down (MATN3 mutations cause early OA), collagen XI down (COL11A1/2 mutations cause cartilage disorders), MMP-2 up (MMPs degrade cartilage in OA), and increased fibronectin fragments and versican are seen in arthritic cartilage too. Periostin is strongly up in arthritic joints and promotes osteophyte formation; our finding of periostin up in disc implies possible calcification or bone spur formation around degenerated discs (which is indeed observed as spondylotic changes). Additionally, infiltration of inflammatory proteins (fibrinogen, etc.) in disc can directly cause pain and nerve sensitization – fibrinogen fragments, for example, can activate macrophages to produce NGF (nerve growth factor), which drives nerve ingrowth and pain sensation. The disc ECM changes correlate with increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α) in degenerated discs. Those cytokines, though not measured here, could be inferred by the presence of an ECM conducive to inflammation (heavy chain-HA complexes, etc.). A vicious cycle can arise in discs: tissue damage → cytokines (IL-1, TNF) → MMPs and aggrecanases → ECM breakdown → release of DAMPs (fibronectin fragments, etc.) → more inflammation. Our data showing decreased TIMP3 and increased MMP2 support this degenerative cascade.
Fibrosis and “Inflammaging” in other organs: The ECM aging patterns are not unique to kidney and disc; similar processes occur in heart (myocardial fibrosis), lung (reduced elastin, increased collagen – leading to stiffness and diastolic dysfunction in heart, or reduced lung compliance), and even skin (loss of collagen elasticity, increased matrix metalloproteinases from UV and age). Interestingly, an exercise study showed resistance training in elderly can reduce circulating inflammatory factors and enhance dermal ECM – this underscores that some of these systemic factors (like CRP, fibrinogen) can be tamed by lifestyle. Also, age-related accumulation of versican and HA is seen in atherosclerotic lesions and eye vitreous changes. IL-17 upregulation has been noted in aging skin and brain, tying immune aging to tissue ECM remodeling (though IL-17B’s role remains less defined, IL-17A clearly drives matrix degradation in cartilage and bone).
Senescence and ECM: Senescent cells often accumulate in aged tissues and secrete a SASP rich in MMPs, cytokines, and growth factors that remodel ECM. In kidney aging, tubular cells become senescent and their SASP (including TGF-β, IL-6) induces fibroblasts to deposit collagen (fibrosis). Senescent cells also downregulate some ECM genes (e.g., collagens) and upregulate others (like fibronectin). Possibly, the drop in certain matrix components like tenascin-X in disc could be from loss of youthful cells, whereas the increase in others comes from activated fibroblasts. The presence of pro-coagulant factors can itself induce senescence as discussed; conversely, a senescent endothelial cell could produce Factor X locally. It’s a tangled web: ECM changes both reflect and promote cellular senescence.
Overall, the ECM alterations we mapped out are not merely consequences of aging – they actively contribute to pathology such as organ fibrosis, degenerative disk disease, and joint osteoarthritis. This means they are potential targets to break the cycle of degeneration.
Potential Interventions to Modulate ECM Aging
Given the contributory role of these ECM changes in functional decline, interventions that target them could mitigate age-related degeneration. Here we outline possible strategies, spanning pharmacological, genetic, and lifestyle approaches:
Anti-fibrotic Therapies: Targeting the TGF-β pathway is a prime approach, as TGF-β is a master regulator of fibrosis (driving collagen I, versican, PAI-1, etc.). Inhibitors like pirfenidone and nintedanib, approved for pulmonary fibrosis, could potentially reduce fibrogenesis in kidney or disc (though delivery to disc is challenging). Another avenue is microRNA modulation: for example, miR-21 is a microRNA upregulated in aging kidneys that promotes fibrosis by suppressing PPARα and augmenting TGF/HIF signaling. A study showed that long-term caloric restriction alleviated kidney fibrosis in aged rats largely by downregulating miR-21. Thus, anti-miR-21 therapy or CR mimetics (e.g. resveratrol) might be used to curb matrix deposition. In discs, inhibiting TGF-β or related fibrotic drivers (e.g. CTGF, LOX) could slow the formation of scar-like matrix. Angiotensin II is another fibrogenic stimulus in kidney (via AT1 receptor and TGF-β induction); hence the common RAAS blockers (ACE inhibitors, ARBs) used for hypertension also reduce renal fibrosis and are standard care to preserve kidney function in aging/CKD. These could indirectly benefit ECM profile by lowering collagen and versican accumulation.
Anti-inflammatory and Immune Modulators: To tackle the “inflammaging” component, interventions like NSAIDs or cytokine blockers may help but need specificity. For example, IL-1 or TNF-α inhibitors (used in rheumatoid arthritis) could potentially reduce disc inflammation, though clinical trials for back pain with these have had mixed results. IL-17A blockade (e.g., secukinumab, approved for psoriasis) has been shown to slow age-related changes in skin and could theoretically reduce inflammation-driven matrix catabolism in cartilage. However, IL-17 also has roles in immune defense, so careful targeting is needed. Mast cell stabilizers or complement inhibitors might be considered if those pathways are proven to be active (complement inhibition is being explored in AMD and other age diseases). For the coagulation aspect, low-dose aspirin or specific Factor Xa inhibitors (like rivaroxaban) have intriguing potential: beyond preventing clots, they may dampen PAR-mediated inflammation. Indeed, the ATLAS trial of rivaroxaban showed reduced cardiovascular events in part perhaps by anti-inflammatory effects. In tissues, a Factor Xa inhibitor could limit the feedback loop of coagulation-induced senescence. One could envision, for example, a therapy combining a fibrinolytic enzyme (to clear fibrin deposits in disc) with an anti-TNF to reduce discogenic inflammation – speculative, but targeting both the cause (fibrin as inflammatory driver) and effect (cytokines). Another approach: colchicine, an old anti-inflammatory that interferes with microtubules, has been shown to reduce fibrosis and inflammation in models of heart and maybe kidney; it might help by suppressing macrophage activation by DAMPs like fibrin.
Senolytic and Senomorphic Drugs: Removing senescent cells or blunting their SASP could dramatically improve ECM quality. In aged kidneys, senolytics like a dasatinib + quercetin cocktail cleared senescent cells and reduced fibrotic matrix, improving function. This has also been shown in mouse disc degeneration models: eliminating senescent disc cells (via compounds or genetic means) led to increased disc height and ECM restoration. Senomorphics (drugs that suppress the SASP without killing the cell) like rapamycin or metformin may also be beneficial; rapamycin in particular can reduce MMP secretion and maybe enhance autophagy to clear aggregated proteins in ECM. Metformin has been linked epidemiologically to less osteoarthritis, possibly through its anti-inflammatory effects on chondrocytes.
Mechanical and Lifestyle Interventions: Exercise and diet have non-trivial effects on ECM aging. Exercise – both aerobic and resistance – can reduce age-related inflammation and fibrosis in multiple tissues. For instance, in the heart, exercise training attenuated collagen I accumulation and preserved compliance in aged rats. In skeletal muscle, exercise increases expression of ECM remodeling enzymes that break down old collagen and stimulate new matrix production, essentially rejuvenating the matrix. A moderate loading regimen on the spine (e.g., targeted physical therapy) might similarly promote disc ECM turnover and nutrition, potentially slowing degeneration. Conversely, overloading or injury accelerates matrix failure, so balancing mechanical stimuli is key. On diet, as noted, caloric restriction (CR) is one of the most robust interventions to delay aging; CR in rodents preserved kidney morphology partly by reducing fibrotic ECM. CR likely works via lowering systemic inflammation (less visceral fat = fewer inflammatory cytokines) and reducing glycation of proteins (lower blood glucose levels). A low-glycemic diet or use of crosslink breakers (like ALT-711, an experimental compound that breaks AGE crosslinks in collagen) could improve arterial elasticity and possibly disc elasticity, though ALT-711 trials in humans had limited success. Nutraceuticals such as curcumin, EGCG (green tea extract), and others have shown anti-fibrotic properties in vitro – curcumin can inhibit TGF-β signaling, for example. While not a cure, they might mildy influence ECM metabolism. Adequate intake of vitamin C is crucial too for collagen turnover, as it’s a cofactor for prolyl hydroxylase (collagen crosslink enzyme); interestingly, high dose vitamin C has been observed to reduce cartilage degeneration in some models (though results are mixed, and too much can paradoxically increase oxidation). Hormonal factors: decline in sex hormones (estrogen, testosterone) in aging is associated with increased fibrosis (e.g., post-menopausal estrogen loss leads to more skin wrinkles and disc degeneration). Hormone replacement or SERMs might have protective matrix effects (estrogen has been shown to increase aggrecan synthesis in discs, and androgens can enhance muscle ECM repair).
Gene Therapy and Regenerative Strategies: For discs in particular, gene therapy or cell therapy is actively researched. Introducing genes for anabolic factors (like growth factors: TGF-β3, IGF-1, BMP7) or anti-catabolic factors (like soluble Wnt inhibitors such as a FRZB transgene or TIMP3 overexpression) directly into degenerated discs has shown promise in animal models. For example, adenoviral delivery of TIMP3 to degenerated rat discs inhibited angiogenesis and nerve growth, reduced TNF activity (by blocking TACE), and diminished pain-associated markers. This aligns perfectly with our data that TIMP3 loss is part of degeneration; giving it back can counteract that by preserving ECM from breakdown and keeping discs avascular (healthy). Similarly, providing sFRP3 (FRZB) to joint cartilage or disc could slow the Wnt-driven hypertrophy and matrix loss – in mice, sFRP3 gene therapy reduced OA severity. Cell therapies (like injecting juvenile chondrocytes or mesenchymal stem cells into discs) likely exert their benefit by secreting ECM proteins and inhibitors – essentially replenishing some of the lost youth factors (e.g., fresh aggrecan, anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1Ra, etc.). Some early clinical trials of MSC injections for disc pain report moderate improvement; the mechanism is thought to include regeneration of ECM and immunomodulation.
Matrix-targeted treatments: There has been exploration of drugs targeting specific matrix components. For instance, PRT-201 (recombinant human elastase) was tested to reduce fibrosis in AV fistulas; conceptually, an enzyme to cleave versican or HA might reduce the maladaptive matrix scaffold. Hyaluronidase injections are sometimes used in cosmetic or scar treatment to dissolve excess hyaluronan; in an inflamed disc, that might break up HA-heavy chain complexes (though it could also remove normal matrix cushioning, so risk/benefit is unclear). Collagenase (C. histolyticum) injections are used for Dupuytren’s contracture to break pathological collagen – perhaps a very controlled use in focal disc fibrosis could increase flexibility (this is hypothetical; uncontrolled collagenase could cause instability). On the flip side, in conditions of matrix loss, one could supply replacement molecules: e.g., intra-discal injection of a collagen II/hyaluronan hydrogel to restore disc height, or use of aggrecan mimetics.
In all, a multi-pronged approach might be needed: reduce excessive matrix deposition (anti-fibrotic), reduce chronic inflammation (anti-cytokine or pro-resolving mediators), support matrix synthesis of needed components (anabolic growth factors or cell therapy), and remove senescent cells (senolytics) so that the matrix milieu becomes more youthful and dynamic.
Biomarker Potential
The differentially expressed ECM proteins identified here could serve as biomarkers of aging and tissue degeneration, aiding early diagnosis or monitoring of intervention efficacy:
Circulating ECM Fragments: During ECM remodeling, fragments of collagens, proteoglycans, and other proteins are released into circulation or urine. For example, urinary collagen IV and laminin fragments are elevated in renal fibrosis; a reduced level might indicate basement membrane loss. Urinary CTX-II (a peptide from collagen II breakdown) is a known marker for cartilage degradation in osteoarthritis – it could similarly reflect disc cartilage loss. If one observed rising CTX-II in an older patient without arthritis, it might hint at disc degeneration progressing. The fibrillar collagen breakdown fragment C1M (from collagen I) and C3M (from collagen III), measured by neo-epitope assays, correlate with fibrotic activity and are being explored as biomarkers in NASH and rheumatoid arthritis; these could apply to kidney fibrosis as well (e.g., elevated C3M could mean active interstitial fibrosis).
Matrix Remodeling Enzymes in fluids: MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels (or their activity) in plasma or urine increase with age-related diseases (e.g., MMP-9 goes up in osteoporotic fracture risk). TIMP levels too – interestingly, low circulating TIMP3 has been associated with worse outcomes in cardiac aging. One could measure the TIMP/MMP ratio as a marker of matrix turnover status.
Versican and its fragments: Full-length versican is mostly tissue-bound, but proteolysis (by ADAMTS proteases) generates a fragment called versikine that can diffuse. Versikine has been detected in serum of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as a disease marker. Similarly, an increase in versikine or other glycoprotein fragments in blood might indicate ongoing matrix remodeling in kidney or disc. Hyaluronan levels in serum also rise with age and fibrosis (hyaluronan is elevated in knee OA synovial fluid, and in liver fibrosis patients’ blood). Since versican and HA go hand-in-hand, high HA could reflect versican-rich matrix turnover.
Inflammatory matrix component biomarkers: We saw many typically plasma-confined proteins appear in tissue with age (fibrinogen, etc.). The converse – their detection in normally isolated compartments or in excretions – could be a biomarker. For instance, fibrinogen or albumin in urine indicates glomerular leak (a sort of ECM failure marker). Fibronectin fragments in urine have been suggested as an early marker for diabetic nephropathy. In disc, we can’t sample disc matrix easily, but an MRI with gadolinium indirectly tells about proteoglycan content (degenerative discs show reduced glycosaminoglycan content and thus less MRI signal on T2 images). So imaging is a biomarker: MRI T2 and T1ρ relaxation times correlate with aggrecan content in discs – a decline in those signals can signal early disc matrix loss even if the patient is asymptomatic.
Secreted factors and SASP markers: FGF2 was present in our data (not strongly changed, but FGF2 tends to increase in injured discs and can drive fibrosis). FGF-2 levels in disc aspirates or even serum might serve as a marker for degenerative activity. Similarly, substance P in tissues or CSF could reflect nociceptive ingrowth into discs (though that’s a late finding). A more accessible marker is C-reactive protein (CRP) – while non-specific, high-sensitivity CRP correlates with many aging processes and is linked to frailty. It could reflect the general pro-inflammatory state that also affects ECM.
Composite “matrix signature”: As suggested in the kidney study, a panel of matrix proteins changes consistently with aging. For kidney, a decrease in urinary COL4α3 and an increase in urinary collagen I fragments plus something like nephronectin might form a multi-marker panel for early kidney aging. For disc, one could imagine a blood test panel that measures, say, COMP (cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, which is released with cartilage damage), hyaluronan, and maybe a collagen II epitope – if these are abnormal in an older adult, it might predict rapid disc degeneration or osteoarthritis progression.
Emerging technologies: Proteomics and glycomics could identify AGE modifications as biomarkers – e.g., measuring pentosidine or carboxymethyl-lysine levels in skin collagen (via skin autofluorescence or biopsy) can gauge systemic matrix aging. Also, extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by senescent or stressed cells contain ECM fragments and miRNAs. A recent concept is that blood EV cargo (like miR-21 levels in EVs for kidney aging) can act as a readout of tissue fibrosis status.
Finally, it’s worth noting that because many ECM proteins are not tissue-specific, using them as biomarkers requires context (e.g., elevated type III collagen fragment could come from liver or skin, not just disc). Thus, combining multiple markers or coupling with imaging might be necessary for specificity. Nevertheless, the fact that some ECM alterations appear before overt disease makes them attractive as early warning biomarkers. For example, if we regularly track an at-risk person’s urine for ECM peptides and find a rising trend in fibrosis markers, interventions could be instituted earlier to prevent CKD.
Conclusions
In this deep proteomic analysis, we examined how aging remodels the extracellular matrix in two anatomically different but pathophysiologically analogous contexts – the kidney’s filtration apparatus and the intervertebral disc. Despite their differences, a unifying theme emerged: aging shifts the ECM from an optimized, tissue-specific structure toward a generalized, fibrosis-prone and inflammation-promoting scaffold. In the kidney, that meant thinning of specialized basement membrane components and buildup of interstitial matrix, laying groundwork for stiffness and chronic kidney disease. In the disc, it meant loss of the gelatinous proteoglycan-rich matrix and ingrowth of fibrous tissue and blood vessels, preluding disc degeneration and back pain. We saw clear molecular signatures of these processes: collagen-IVα3 and aggrecan down, versican and fibrinogen up – essentially, “out with the old (specialized matrix), in with the new (scar tissue).” These ECM changes do not act in isolation but form a network of positive feedback loops with cellular aging processes (senescence, inflammaging). The identification of key nodes in this network – like versican, fibrinogen, MMP-2, TIMP3, FRZB, and others – provides not only insight into mechanism but also tangible targets. Interventions such as anti-fibrotics, cytokine inhibitors, Wnt modulators, or senolytic therapies have the potential to disrupt these deleterious feedback loops. For example, restoring TIMP3 or sFRP3 levels in an aging disc might halt its degeneration by curbing angiogenesis and Wnt signaling; caloric restriction or drugs mimicking it can slow kidney fibrosis by tweaking miR-21 and metabolic pathways. Importantly, the ECM components highlighted here could be harnessed as biomarkers to monitor tissue aging. A panel of matrix protein fragments in blood or urine might one day serve as an “ECM clock” of biological aging, indicating if a person’s tissues are aging faster or slower than expected. Some of these markers, like versican fragments or collagen peptides, are already under investigation in fibrotic diseases. By translating these research findings into clinical tools, we could achieve earlier diagnosis of age-related degeneration (e.g., detecting subclinical disc degeneration before it causes irreversible damage) and track the effectiveness of interventions (does a senolytic reduce the fibrosis marker profile?). In conclusion, our analysis underscores that the extracellular matrix is both a mirror and a mediator of aging. It captures a history of wear and tear (through accumulated crosslinks and fragmentary remnants of youthful proteins), and it actively orchestrates future decline (by regulating cell behavior and inflammation). However, unlike fixed genetic factors, the ECM is a dynamic entity – one that we may be able to repair or rejuvenate. The top insights from this study – such as the pivotal role of versican complexes in aging inflammation, the contribution of coagulation factors to chronic tissue damage, and the protective effects of certain ECM regulators like TIMP3 and FRZB – point toward integrative treatment strategies. Attacking aging from an ECM-centric angle, combined with systemic approaches (diet, exercise, senolytics), could help mitigate the “stiffness and inflammation” that characterize old tissues. In the bigger picture, preserving ECM health is essential for maintaining organ function and mobility with age. By identifying the weak links and key drivers in the aging ECM, we move closer to therapies that keep our kidneys filtering and our spines flexible well into our later years – essentially, treatments that help us age not only longer, but better. Sources: Recent literature and database sources were consulted to support our analysis, including proteomics studies of aging ECM, reviews on versican in inflammation, studies on coagulation-inflammation links, disc degeneration research, and aging intervention trials, among others, as cited throughout the text. These provide context and evidence for the roles, interactions, and therapeutic angles discussed. The concordance between our data-driven findings and the published knowledge strengthens confidence in the biological validity of these results. Going forward, experimental validation (e.g., immunohistochemistry for COL4A3 or versican in young vs old tissue, functional assays modulating these proteins in animal models) would be valuable next steps to translate these insights into biomedical innovations.
