# Chmelova 2023 - Age Bin Normalization Analysis (LFQ)

## 1. Method Verification
- Quantification method: RNA-Seq with log2Norm.counts
- LFQ compatible: NO - This is transcriptomics data (RNA-Seq), NOT proteomics
- **EXCLUDED FROM LFQ PROTEOMIC ANALYSIS**

## 2. Current Age Groups
- Young adult: 3 months
- Aged: 18 months
- Total samples: Not specified in available analysis
- File/sheet: `Data Sheet 1.XLSX`, sheet "protein.expression.imputed.new("

## 3. Species Context
- Species: Mus musculus
- Lifespan reference: ~24-30 months
- Aging cutoffs applied:
  - Mouse: young ≤4 months, old ≥18 months
  - Study groups: 3 months (young) vs 18 months (old)

## 4. Age Bin Mapping (Conservative - USER-APPROVED)

### STUDY EXCLUDED - NOT PROTEOMICS
This study uses RNA-Seq methodology (transcriptomics), not label-free quantitative proteomics. While it analyzes extracellular matrix-related genes at the transcript level, it does not provide protein-level quantification.

**Method type:** Transcriptomics (RNA-Seq)
- Data unit: log2Norm.counts (RNA transcript counts)
- Reason for exclusion: Not protein quantification
- Status: DEFERRED - Not applicable to LFQ-focused proteomic analysis

**Note:** Although the data shows young (3mo) vs old (18mo) groups that would align with age bin cutoffs, the fundamental data type (RNA vs protein) excludes it from this proteomic meta-analysis.

### Impact Assessment
- **Data retained:** N/A (study excluded)
- **Data excluded:** 100% (wrong data modality)
- **Meets ≥66% threshold?** N/A
- **Signal strength:** N/A - not proteomic data

## 5. Column Mapping Verification

### Source File Identification
- Primary file: `Data Sheet 1.XLSX`
- Sheet/tab name: "protein.expression.imputed.new("
- File size: 17 rows × unknown columns
- Format: Excel (.xlsx)
- **Data type:** RNA-Seq transcript counts (NOT proteomic)

### 13-Column Schema Mapping

**MAPPING NOT PERFORMED - STUDY EXCLUDED**

This study does not provide proteomic data and therefore cannot be mapped to the 13-column proteomic schema. The data contains:
- Gene symbols (not protein IDs)
- log2 normalized transcript counts (not protein abundances)
- RNA-Seq methodology (not mass spectrometry)

### Mapping Gaps (if any)

❌ **Fundamental data type mismatch**
- Problem: Study provides transcriptomics data, not proteomics data
- Impact: Cannot populate protein-specific columns (Protein_ID, Protein_Name, Abundance from MS)
- Proposed solution: Exclude from LFQ proteomic analysis; consider for future transcriptomics integration if needed

## 6. Implementation Notes
**STUDY EXCLUDED FROM PARSING**
- Reason: RNA-Seq transcriptomics, not label-free proteomics
- Method incompatibility: log2Norm.counts refers to transcript abundance, not protein abundance
- Recommendation: Do not parse this study for the LFQ proteomic atlas
- Future consideration: May be valuable for ECM gene expression analysis in a separate transcriptomics track
